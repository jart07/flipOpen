Open source php/ajax/jQuery audio book platform. Open source php/ajax/jQuery audio book platform. This is a project designed to fill a hole in connecting free texts from Project Gutenberg with free audio books from LibriVox in a book-like digital environment. It uses jQuery for ajax and front-end interface, and php for a backend. The goal is to serve up valid html pages with textual content from free literature in a pleasant way along with free audio. Our early focus is on English literacy using early 20th century fiction by E. Nesbit.
