<HEAD>CHAPTER I</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> house was three miles from the station, but before the
dusty hired fly had rattled along for five minutes, the children began to
put their heads out of the carriage window and to say, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
we nearly there?&rdquo; And every time they passed a house, which was not
very often, they all said, &ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>is</EMPH> this it?&rdquo; But
it never was, till they reached the very top of the hill, just past the
chalk&hyphen;quarry and before you come to the gravel&hyphen;pit. And then
there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond, and
mother said, &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p2" N="2">
<P>&ldquo;How white the house is,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And look at the roses,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And the plums,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is rather decent,&rdquo; Cyril admitted.</P>
<P>The Baby said, &ldquo;Wanty go walky&rdquo;; and the fly stopped with a
last rattle and jolt.</P>
<P>Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to
get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind.
Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she had
come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she seemed to
wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver, instead of
joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and
the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and
the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the children were wiser, for
once. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and
mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there
being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father
used to say that the iron&hyphen;work on the roof and coping was
<PB ID="pf2">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five002"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p3" N="3">
like an architect&rsquo;s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country,
with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two
years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an
excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy
Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise. For London is like prison for
children, especially if their relations are not rich.</P>
<P>Of course there are the shops and the theatres, and Maskelyne and
Cook&rsquo;s, and things, but if your people are rather poor you
don&rsquo;t get taken to the theatres, and you can&rsquo;t buy things out
of the shops; and London has none of those nice things that children may
play with without hurting the things or themselves&mdash;such as trees and
sand and woods and waters. And nearly everything in London is the wrong
sort of shape&mdash;all straight lines and flat streets, instead of being
all sorts of odd shapes, like things are in the country. Trees are all
different, as you know, and I am sure some tiresome person must have told
you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike. But in streets,
where the blades of grass don&rsquo;t grow,
<PB ID="p4" N="4">
everything is like everything else. This is why so many children who live
in towns are so extremely naughty. They do not know what is the matter with
them, and no more do their fathers and mothers, aunts, uncles, cousins,
tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I know. And so do you, now. Children
in the country are naughty sometimes, too, but that is for quite different
reasons.</P>
<P>The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly
before they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well that
they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so from the
first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered with
jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the most
expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present; and when they
had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different from the brown
grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they had found the stable
with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were almost certain;
and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it
<PB ID="pf5">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five005"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p5" N="5">
and got a lump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had nipped his
finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in, if you
ever had any, they had no longer any doubts whatever.</P>
<P>The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to
places and not doing things. In London almost everything is labelled
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t touch,&rdquo; and though the label is invisible
it&rsquo;s just as bad, because you know it&rsquo;s there, or if you
don&rsquo;t you jolly soon get told.</P>
<P>The White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind
it&mdash;and the chalk&hyphen;quarry on one side and the gravel&hyphen;pit
on the other. Down at the bottom of the hill was a level plain, with
queer&hyphen;shaped white buildings where people burnt lime, and a big red
brewery and other houses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the
sun was setting, the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist,
and the limekilns and oast&hyphen;houses glimmered and glittered till they
were like an enchanted city out of the <BIBL>Arabian Nights</BIBL>.</P>
<P>Now that I have begun to tell you about
<PB ID="p6" N="6">
the place, I feel that I could go on and make this into a most interesting
story about all the ordinary things that the children did,&mdash;just the
kind of things you do yourself, you know,&mdash;and you would believe every
word of it; and when I told about the children&rsquo;s being tiresome, as
you are sometimes, your aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the
story with a pencil, &ldquo;How true!&rdquo; or &ldquo;How like
life!&rdquo; and you would see it and very likely be annoyed. So I will
only tell you the really astonishing things that happened, and you may
leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts and uncles either are
likely to write &ldquo;How true!&rdquo; on the edge of the story.
Grown&hyphen;up people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful
things, unless they have what they call proof. But children will believe
almost anything, and grown&hyphen;ups know this. That is why they tell you
that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see perfectly well
that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the earth goes round the
sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the sun gets up in the
morning and goes to bed at night like a good
<PB ID="p7" N="7">
sun as it is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse.
Yet I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so
you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and the
others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At least they
called it that, because that was what it called itself; and of course it
knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever saw or heard of or
read about.</P>
<P>It was at the gravel&hyphen;pits. Father had to go away suddenly on
business, and mother had gone away to stay with Granny, who was not very
well. They both went in a great hurry, and when they were gone the house
seemed dreadfully quiet and empty, and the children wandered from one room
to another and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors left
over from the packing, and not yet cleared up, and wished they had
something to do. It was Cyril who said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say, let&rsquo;s take our Margate spades and go and dig in the
gravel&hyphen;pits. We can pretend it&rsquo;s seaside.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Father said it was once,&rdquo; Anthea said; &ldquo;he
<PB ID="p8" N="8">
says there are shells there thousands of years old.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they went. Of course they had been to the edge of the
gravel&hyphen;pit and looked over, but they had not gone down into it for
fear father should say they mustn&rsquo;t play there, and the same with the
chalk&hyphen;quarry. The gravel&hyphen;out is not really dangerous if you
don&rsquo;t try to climb down the edges, but go the slow safe way round by
the road, as if you were a cart.</P>
<P>Each of the children carried its own spade, and took it in turns to
carry the Lamb. He was the baby, and they called him that because
&ldquo;Baa&rdquo; was the first thing he ever said. They called Anthea
&ldquo;Panther,&rdquo; which seems silly when you read it, but when you say
it it sounds a little like her name.</P>
<P>The gravel&hyphen;pit is very large and wide, with grass growing round
the edges at the top, and dry stringy wild&hyphen;flowers, purple and
yellow. It is like a giant&rsquo;s wash&hyphen;hand basin. And there are
mounds of gravel, and holes in the sides of the basin where gravel has been
taken out, and high up in the steep sides there are the
<PB ID="p9" N="9">
little holes that are the little front doors of the little
sand&hyphen;martins&rsquo; little houses.</P>
<P>The children built a castle, of course, but castle&hyphen;building is
rather poor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming in
to fill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge, and, at the happy last,
to wet everybody up to the waist at least.</P>
<P>Cyril wanted to dig out a cave to play smugglers in, but the others
thought it might bury him alive, so it ended in all spades going to work to
dig a hole through the castle to Australia. The children, you see, believed
that the world was round, and that on the other side the little Australian
boys and girls were really walking wrong way up, like flies on the ceiling,
with their heads hanging down into the air.</P>
<P>The children dug and they dug and they dug, and their hands got sandy
and hot and red, and their faces got damp and shiny. The Lamb had tried to
eat the sand, and had cried so hard when he found that it was not, as he
had supposed, brown sugar, that he was now tired out, and was lying asleep
in a warm fat
<PB ID="p10" N="10">
bunch in the middle of the half&hyphen;finished castle. This left his
brothers and sisters free to work really hard, and the hole that was to
come out in Australia soon grew so deep that Jane, who was called Pussy for
short, begged the others to stop.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose the bottom of the hole gave way suddenly,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and you tumbled out among the little Australians, all the sand
would get in their eyes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;and they would hate us, and throw
stones at us, and not let us see the kangaroos, or opossums, or
blue&hyphen;gums, or Emu Brand birds, or anything.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril and Anthea knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that,
but they agreed to stop using their spades and go on with their hands. This
was quite easy, because the sand at the bottom of the hole was very soft
and fine and dry, like sea&hyphen;sand. And there were little shells in
it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fancy it having been wet sea here once, all sloppy and
shiny,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;with fishes and conger&hyphen;eels and
coral and mermaids.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish
<PB ID="p11" N="11">
treasure. I wish we could find a gold doubloon, or something,&rdquo; Cyril
said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How did the sea get carried away?&rdquo; Robert asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not in a pail, silly,&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;Father says
the earth got too hot underneath, like you do in bed sometimes, so it just
hunched up it shoulders, and the sea had to slip off, like the blankets do
off us, and the shoulder was left sticking out, and turned into dry land.
Let&rsquo;s go and look for shells; I think that little cave looks likely,
and I see something sticking out there like a bit of wrecked ship&rsquo;s
anchor, and it&rsquo;s beastly hot in the Australian hole.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others agreed, but Anthea went on digging. She always liked to
finish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a disgrace
to leave that hole without getting through to Australia.</P>
<P>The cave was disappointing, because there were no shells, and the
wrecked ship&rsquo;s anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a
pickaxe handle, and the cave party were just making up their minds that
sand makes
<PB ID="p12" N="12">
you thirstier when it is not by the seaside, and someone had suggested
going home for lemonade, when Anthea suddenly screamed&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Cyril! Come here! Oh, come quick! It&rsquo;s alive! It&rsquo;ll
get away! Quick!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They all hurried back.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rat, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;Father says they infest old places&mdash;and this must be pretty old
if the sea was here thousands of years ago.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Perhaps it is a snake,&rdquo; said Jane, shuddering.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look,&rdquo; said Cyril, jumping into the hole.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of snakes. I like them. If it&rsquo;s a snake
I&rsquo;ll tame it, and it will follow me everywhere, and I&rsquo;ll let it
sleep round my neck at night.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Robert firmly. He shared
Cyril&rsquo;s bedroom. &ldquo;But you may if it&rsquo;s a rat.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not a rat, it&rsquo;s <EMPH>much</EMPH> bigger. And it&rsquo;s not a snake.
It&rsquo;s got feet; I saw them; and fur! No&mdash;not the spade.
You&rsquo;ll hurt it! Dig with your hands.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="pf12">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five012"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p13" N="13">
<P>&ldquo;And let <EMPH>it</EMPH> hurt <EMPH>me</EMPH> instead!
That&rsquo;s so likely, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Cyril, seizing a
spade.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Squirrel,
<EMPH>don&rsquo;t</EMPH>. I&mdash;it sounds silly, but it said something.
It really and truly did.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It said, &lsquo;You let me alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P>But Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her nut,
and he and Robert dug with spades while Anthea sat on the edge of the hole,
jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety. They dug carefully, and
presently everyone could see that there really was something moving in the
bottom of the Australian hole.</P>
<P>Then Anthea cried out. &ldquo;<EMPH>I&rsquo;m</EMPH> not afraid. Let me
dig,&rdquo; and fell on her knees and began to scratch like a dog does when
he has suddenly remembered where it was that he buried his bone.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I felt fur,&rdquo; she cried, half laughing and half crying.
&ldquo;I did indeed! I did!&rdquo; when suddenly a dry husky voice in the
sand made them all jump back, and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as
they did.</P>
<PB ID="p14" N="14">
<P>&ldquo;Let me alone,&rdquo; it said. And now everyone heard the voice
and looked at the others to see if they had too.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we want to see you,&rdquo; said Robert bravely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come out,&rdquo; said Anthea, also taking
courage.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;if that&rsquo;s your wish,&rdquo; the voice said,
and the sand stirred and spun and scattered, and something brown and furry
and fat came rolling out into the hole, and the sand fell off it, and it
sat there yawning and rubbing the ends of its eyes with its hands.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I believe I must have dropped asleep,&rdquo; it said, stretching
itself.</P>
<P>The children stood round the hole in a ring, looking at the creature
they had found. It was worth looking at. Its eyes were on long horns like a
snail&rsquo;s eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it
had ears like a bat&rsquo;s ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a
spider&rsquo;s and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were
furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey&rsquo;s.</P>
<PB ID="p15" N="15">
<P>&ldquo;What on earth is it?&rdquo; Jane said. &ldquo;Shall we take it
home?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The thing turned its long eyes to look at her, and
said&colon;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Does she always talk nonsense, or is it only the rubbish on her
head that makes her silly?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It looked scornfully at Jane&rsquo;s hat as it spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t mean to be silly,&rdquo; Anthea said gently;
&ldquo;we none of us do, whatever you may think! Don&rsquo;t be frightened;
we don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hurt <EMPH>me</EMPH>!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;<EMPH>Me</EMPH>
frightened! Upon my word! Why, you talk as if I were nobody in
particular.&rdquo; All its fur stood out like a cat&rsquo;s when it is
going to fight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anthea, still kindly, &ldquo;perhaps if we knew
who you are in particular we could think of something to say that
wouldn&rsquo;t make you cross. Everything we&rsquo;ve said so far seems to
have. Who are you? And don&rsquo;t get angry! Because really we don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Well, I knew the
world had changed&mdash;but&mdash;well, really&mdash;
<PB ID="p16" N="16">
do you mean to tell me seriously you don&rsquo;t know a Psammead when you
see one?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A Sammyadd? That&rsquo;s Greek to me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;So it is to everyone,&rdquo; said the creature sharply.
&ldquo;Well, in plain English, then, a <EMPH>Sand&hyphen;fairy</EMPH>.
Don&rsquo;t you know a Sand&hyphen;fairy when you see one?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, &ldquo;Of
course I see you are, <EMPH>now</EMPH>. It&rsquo;s quite plain now one
comes to look at you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You came to look at me several sentences ago,&rdquo; it said
crossly, beginning to curl up again in the sand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;don&rsquo;t go away again! Do talk some more,&rdquo;
Robert cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were a Sandy&hyphen;fairy, but
I knew directly I saw you that you were much the wonderfullest thing
I&rsquo;d ever seen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Sand&hyphen;fairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t talking I mind,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;as long as
you&rsquo;re reasonably civil. But I&rsquo;m not going to make polite
conversation for you. If you talk nicely to me, perhaps I&rsquo;ll answer
you, and perhaps I won&rsquo;t. Now say something.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p17" N="17">
<P>Of course no one could think of anything to say, but at last Robert
thought of &ldquo;How long have you lived here?&rdquo; and he said it at
once.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, ages&mdash;several thousand years,&rdquo; replied the
Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell us all about it. Do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in books.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>You</EMPH> aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jane said. &ldquo;Oh, tell
us everything you can about yourself! We don&rsquo;t know anything about
you, and you <EMPH>are</EMPH> so nice.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Sand&hyphen;fairy smoothed his long rat&hyphen;like whiskers and
smiled between them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do please tell!&rdquo; said the children all together.</P>
<P>It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most
astonishing. Five minutes before, the children had had no more idea than
you that there was such a thing as a sand&hyphen;fairy in the world, and
now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their
lives.</P>
<P>It drew its eyes in and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How very sunny it is&mdash;quite like old times!
<PB ID="p18" N="18">
Where do you get your Megatheriums from now?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the children all at once. It is very difficult
always to remember that &ldquo;what&rdquo; is not polite, especially in
moments of surprise or agitation.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are Pterodactyls plentiful now?&rdquo; the Sand&hyphen;fairy went
on.</P>
<P>The children were unable to reply.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What do you have for breakfast? &rdquo; the Fairy said
impatiently, &ldquo;and who gives it you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Eggs and bacon, and bread and milk, and porridge and things.
Mother gives it us. What are
Mega&hyphen;what&rsquo;s&hyphen;it&rsquo;s&hyphen;names and
Ptero&hyphen;what&hyphen;do&hyphen;you&hyphen;call&hyphen;thems? And does
anyone have them for breakfast?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time!
Pterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like
birds&mdash;I believe they were very good grilled. You see it was like
this&colon; of course there were heaps of sand&hyphen;fairies then, and in
the morning early you went out and hunted for them, and when you&rsquo;d
found one it gave you your wish. People used to send their little boys down
to
<PB ID="p19" N="19">
the seashore early in the morning before breakfast to get the day&rsquo;s
wishes, and very often the eldest boy in the family would be told to wish
for a Megatherium, ready jointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant,
you see, so there was a good deal of meat on it. And if they wanted fish,
the Ichthyosaurus was asked for,&mdash;he was twenty to forty feet long, so
there was plenty of him. And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus; there
were nice pickings on that too. Then the other children could wish for
other things. But when people had dinner&hyphen;parties it was nearly
always Megatheriums; and Ichthyosaurus, because his fins were a great
delicacy and his tail made soup.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left
over,&rdquo; said Anthea, who meant to be a good housekeeper some day.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;that would never have
done. Why, of course at sunset what was left over turned into stone. You
find the stone bones of the Megatherium and things all over the place even
now, they tell me.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p20" N="20">
<P>&ldquo;Who tell you?&rdquo; asked Cyril; but the Sand&hyphen;fairy
frowned and began to dig very fast with its furry hands.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; they all cried; &ldquo;tell us more
about it when it was Megatheriums for breakfast! Was the world like this
then?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It stopped digging.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;it was nearly all sand where I
lived, and coal grew on trees, and the periwinkles were as big as
tea&hyphen;trays&mdash;you find them now; they&rsquo;re turned into stone.
We sand&hyphen;fairies used to live on the seashore, and the children used
to come with their little flint&hyphen;spades and flint&hyphen;pails and
make castles for us to live in. That&rsquo;s thousands of years ago, but I
hear that children still build castles on the sand. It&rsquo;s difficult to
break yourself off a habit.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But why did you stop living in the castles?&rdquo; asked
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad story,&rdquo; said the Psammead gloomily.
&ldquo;It was because they <EMPH>would</EMPH> build moats to the castles,
and the nasty wet bubbling sea used to come in, and of course as soon as a
sand&hyphen;fairy got wet it caught cold, and
<PB ID="p21" N="21">
generally died. And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and, whenever you
found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a Megatherium, and eat
twice as much as you wanted, because it might be weeks before you got
another wish.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And did <EMPH>you</EMPH> get wet?&rdquo; Robert inquired.</P>
<P>The Sand&hyphen;fairy shuddered. &ldquo;Only once,&rdquo; it said;
&ldquo;the end of the twelfth hair of my top left whisker&mdash;I feel the
place still in damp weather. It was only once, but it was quite enough for
me. I went away as soon as the sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I
skurried away to the back of the beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm
dry sand, and there I&rsquo;ve been ever since. And the sea changed its
lodgings afterwards. And now I&rsquo;m not going to tell you another
thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Just one more, please,&rdquo; said the children. &ldquo;Can you
give wishes now?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said it, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I give you yours a
few minutes ago? You said, &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come out,&rsquo; and I
did.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, please, mayn&rsquo;t we have another?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p22" N="22">
<P>&ldquo;Yes, but be quick about it. I&rsquo;m tired of you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three
wishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the
black&hyphen;pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you
could think of three really useful wishes without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation. These children had often talked this matter over, but, now the
chance had suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; said the Sand&hyphen;fairy crossly. No one could
think of anything, only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her
own and Jane&rsquo;s which they had never told the boys. She knew the boys
would not care about it&mdash;but still it was better than nothing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we were all as beautiful as the day,&rdquo; she said in a
great hurry.</P>
<P>The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others
were not any better&hyphen;looking than usual. The Psammead pushed out its
long eyes, and seemed to be holding
<PB ID="p23" N="23">
its breath and swelling itself out till it was twice as fat and furry as
before. Suddenly it lets its breath go in a long sigh.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really afraid I can&rsquo;t manage it,&rdquo; it said
apologetically, &ldquo;I must be out of practice.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children were horribly disappointed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>do</EMPH> try again!&rdquo; they said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Sand&hyphen;fairy, &ldquo;the fact is, I
was keeping back a little strength to give the rest of you your wishes
with. If you&rsquo;ll be contented with one wish a day amongst the lot of
you I daresay I can screw myself up to do it. Do you agree to
that?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes!&rdquo; said Jane and Anthea. The boys nodded. They
did not believe the Sand&hyphen;fairy could do it. You can always make
girls believe things much easier than you can boys.</P>
<P>It stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and
swelled.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I do hope it won&rsquo;t hurt itself,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or crack its skin,&rdquo; Robert said anxiously.</P>
<P>Everyone was very much relieved when the Sand&hyphen;fairy, after
getting so big that it almost
<PB ID="p24" N="24">
filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its breath and went back
to its proper size.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; it said, panting heavily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come easier to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Did it hurt much?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Only my poor whisker, thank you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;re a kind and thoughtful child. Good day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and
disappeared in the sand. Then the children looked at each other, and each
child suddenly found itself alone with three perfect strangers, all
radiantly beautiful.</P>
<P>They stood for some moments in perfect silence. Each thought that its
brothers and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had
stolen up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the
Sand&hyphen;fairy. Anthea spoke first&mdash; </P>
<P>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said very politely to Jane, who now had
enormous blue eyes and a cloud of russet hair, &ldquo;but have you seen two
little boys and a little girl anywhere about?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I was just going to ask you that,&rdquo; said Jane. And then
Cyril cried&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p25" N="25">
<P>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s <EMPH>you</EMPH>! I know the hole in your
pinafore! You <EMPH>are</EMPH> Jane, aren&rsquo;t you? And you&rsquo;re the
Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief that you forgot to change after
you&rsquo;d cut your thumb! Crikey! The wish <EMPH>has</EMPH> come off,
after all. I say, am I as handsome as you are?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Cyril, I liked you much better as you were
before,&rdquo; said Anthea decidedly. &ldquo;You look like the picture of
the young chorister, with your golden hair; you&rsquo;ll die young, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. And if that&rsquo;s Robert, he&rsquo;s like an
Italian organ&hyphen;grinder. His hair&rsquo;s all black.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You two girls are like Christmas cards, then&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all&mdash;silly Christmas cards,&rdquo; said Robert angrily. &ldquo;And
Jane&rsquo;s hair is simply carrots.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use finding fault with each other,&rdquo;
said Anthea; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner. The
servants will admire us most awfully, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Baby was just waking when they got to
<PB ID="p26" N="26">
him, and not one of the children but was relieved to find that he at least
was not as beautiful as the day, but just the same as usual.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s too young to have wishes naturally,&rdquo;
said Jane. &ldquo;We shall have to mention him specially next
time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea ran forward and held out her arms.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come to own Panther, ducky,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>The Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his
mouth. Anthea was his favourite sister.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;G&rsquo;way long!&rdquo; said the Baby.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come to own Pussy,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wants my Panty,&rdquo; said the Lamb dismally, and his lip
trembled.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, come on, Veteran,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;come and have
a yidey on Yobby&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yah, narky narky boy,&rdquo; howled the Baby, giving way
altogether. Then the children knew the worst. <EMPH>he Baby did not know
them!</EMPH></P>
<P>They looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in
this dire emergency,
<PB ID="pf26">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five026"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p27" N="27">
to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect strangers, instead of the merry,
friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly little eyes of its own brothers and
sisters.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This is most truly awful,&rdquo; said Cyril when he had tried to
lift up the Lamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a
bull. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to <EMPH>make friends</EMPH> with him! I
can&rsquo;t carry him home screaming like that. Fancy having to make
friends with our own baby!&mdash;it&rsquo;s too silly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>That, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour,
and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was by
this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert.</P>
<P>At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by
turns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a dead
weight, and most exhausting.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank goodness, we&rsquo;re home!&rdquo; said Jane, staggering
through the iron gates to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front
door shading her eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. &ldquo;Here!
Do take Baby!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p28" N="28">
<P>Martha snatched the Baby from her arms.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thanks be, <EMPH>he&rsquo;s</EMPH> safe back,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Where are the others, and whoever to goodness gracious are all of
you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <EMPH>us</EMPH>, of course,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Us, when you&rsquo;re at home?&rdquo; asked
Martha scornfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s <EMPH>us</EMPH>, only we&rsquo;re beautiful
as the day,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Cyril, and these are the
others, and we&rsquo;re jolly hungry. Let us in, and don&rsquo;t be a silly
idiot.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Martha merely dratted Cyril&rsquo;s impudence and tried to shut the door
in his face.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know we <EMPH>look</EMPH> different, but I&rsquo;m Anthea, and
we&rsquo;re so tired, and it&rsquo;s long past
dinner&hyphen;time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our
children put you up to this play&hyphen;acting you can tell them from me
they&rsquo;ll catch it, so they know what to expect!&rdquo; With that she
did bang the door. Cyril rang the bell violently. No answer. Presently cook
put her head out of a bedroom window and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t take yourself off, and that
<PB ID="p29" N="29">
precious sharp, I&rsquo;ll go and fetch the police.&rdquo; And she slammed
down the window.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Oh, do, do come
away before we get sent to prison!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn&rsquo;t put
you in prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they
followed the others out into the lane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Cyril said sadly; &ldquo;it
mayn&rsquo;t be like that now&mdash;things have changed a good deal since
Megatherium times.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Anthea suddenly, &ldquo;perhaps we shall turn
into stone at sunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn&rsquo;t
be any of us left over for the next day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She began to cry, so did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the
heart to say anything.</P>
<P>It was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children
could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to go
to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a basket,
<PB ID="p30" N="30">
and there was a local constable. True, they were all as beautiful as the
day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry as a hunter and as
thirsty as a sponge.</P>
<P>Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to
let them in and listen to their tale. And then Robert went alone, hoping to
be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door to the
others. But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied a
toilet&hyphen;jug of cold water over him from a top window, and
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go along with you, you nasty little Eyetalian monkey.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with
their feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether, when
the sun <EMPH>did</EMPH> set, they would turn into stone, or only into
their own old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among
strangers and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices
were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite
irritating to look at.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we <EMPH>shall</EMPH> turn to stone,&rdquo;
said
<PB ID="pf30">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five030"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p31" N="31">
Robert, breaking a long miserable silence, &ldquo;because the
Sand&hyphen;fairy said he&rsquo;d give us another wish to&hyphen;morrow,
and he couldn&rsquo;t if we were stone, could he?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but they weren&rsquo;t at all
comforted.</P>
<P>Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril&rsquo;s
suddenly saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to frighten you girls, but I
believe it&rsquo;s beginning with me already. My foot&rsquo;s quite dead.
I&rsquo;m turning to stone, I know I am, and so will you in a
minute.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Robert kindly, &ldquo;perhaps
you&rsquo;ll be the only stone one, and the rest of us will be all right,
and we&rsquo;ll cherish your statue and hang garlands on it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But when it turned out that Cyril&rsquo;s foot had only gone to sleep
through his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in
an agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Giving us such a fright for nothing!&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane. She
said&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p32" N="32">
<P>&ldquo;If we <EMPH>do</EMPH> come out of this all right we&rsquo;ll ask
the Sammyadd to make it so that the servants don&rsquo;t notice anything
different, no matter what wishes we have.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others only grunted. They were too wretched even to make good
resolutions.</P>
<P>At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness&mdash;four very
nasty things&mdash;all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that
was sleep. The children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut
and their beautiful mouths open. Anthea woke first. The sun had set, and
the twilight was coming on.</P>
<P>Anthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she
could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then she
pinched the others. They, also, were soft.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; she said, almost in tears for joy;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right, we&rsquo;re not stone. And oh, Cyril, how nice
and ugly you do look, with your old freckles and your brown hair and your
little eyes. And so do you all!&rdquo; she added, so that they might not
feel jealous.</P>
<P>When they got home they were very much
<PB ID="p33" N="33">
scolded by Martha, who told them about the strange children.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A good&hyphen;looking lot, I must say, but that
impudent.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless
it would be to try to explain things to Martha.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty
little things, you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the lane.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come home hours ago?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t because of <EMPH>them</EMPH>,&rdquo; said
Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The children who were as beautiful as the day. They kept us there
till after sunset. We couldn&rsquo;t come back till they&rsquo;d gone. You
don&rsquo;t know how we hated them! Oh, do, do give us some supper&mdash;we
are so hungry.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hungry! I should think so,&rdquo; said Martha angrily; &ldquo;out
all day like this. Well, I hope it&rsquo;ll be a lesson to you not to go
picking up with strange children&mdash;down here after measles, as likely
as not. Now mind, if you see them again, don&rsquo;t you speak to
them&mdash;not one word nor so much as a look&mdash;but come straight
<PB ID="p34" N="34">
away and tell me. I&rsquo;ll spoil their beauty for them!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If ever we <EMPH>do</EMPH> see them again we&rsquo;ll tell
you,&rdquo; Anthea said; and Robert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold
beef that was being brought in on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt
undertones&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll take jolly good care we never <EMPH>do</EMPH> see
them again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And they never have.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOLDEN GUINEAS</HEAD>
<P><HI>ANTHEA</HI> woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in
which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day
without any umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the
rain, and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and
the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular
breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep.
The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea&rsquo;s face from the wet corner
of a bath&hyphen;towel which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the
water out of, to wake her up, as he now explained.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, drop it!&rdquo; she said rather crossly; so he did, for he
was not a brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple&hyphen;pie beds,
booby&hyphen;traps,
<PB ID="p36" N="36">
original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other little
accomplishments which made home happy.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I had such a funny dream,&rdquo; Anthea began.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Jane, wakening suddenly and without
warning. &ldquo;I dreamed we found a Sand&hyphen;fairy in the
gravel&hyphen;pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd, and we might have a new
wish every day, and&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what <EMPH>I</EMPH> dreamed,&rdquo; said Robert;
&ldquo;I was just going to tell you&mdash;and we had the first wish
directly it said so. And I dreamed you girls were donkeys enough to ask for
us all to be beautiful as the day, and we jolly well were, and it was
perfectly beastly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But <EMPH>can</EMPH> different people all dream the same
thing?&rdquo; said Anthea, sitting up in bed, &ldquo;because I dreamed all
that as well as about the Zoo and the rain; and Baby didn&rsquo;t know us
in my dream, and the servants shut us out of the house because the
radiantness of our beauty was such a complete disguise,
and&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing.</P>
<PB ID="p37" N="37">
<P>&ldquo;Come on Robert,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be late for
breakfast again&mdash;unless you mean to shirk your bath like you did on
Tuesday.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say, come here a sec,&rdquo; Robert replied. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t shirk it; I had it after brekker in father&rsquo;s
dressing&hyphen;room, because ours was emptied away.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve all had such an
odd dream. We&rsquo;ve all dreamed we found a Sand&hyphen;fairy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Her voice died away before Cyril&rsquo;s contemptuous glance.
&ldquo;Dream?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you little sillies, it&rsquo;s
<EMPH>true</EMPH>. I tell you it all happened. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
so keen on being down early. We&rsquo;ll go up there directly after
brekker, and have another wish. Only we&rsquo;ll make up our minds, solid,
before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask for anything
unless the others agree first. No more peerless beauties for this child,
thank you. Not if I know it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about
the Sand&hyphen;fairy
<PB ID="p38" N="38">
was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream, the girls thought.
Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not sure, till after they
had seen Martha and heard her full and plain reminders about their naughty
conduct the day before. Then Anthea was sure. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;servants never dream anything but the things in the
Dream&hyphen;book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding&mdash;
that means a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are
babies.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Talking of babies,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the
Lamb?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins.
Mother said she might. She&rsquo;s dressing him now,&rdquo; said Jane,
&ldquo;in his very best coat and hat. Bread&hyphen;and&hyphen;butter,
please.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She seems to like taking him too,&rdquo; said Robert in a tone of
wonder.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Servants <EMPH>do</EMPH> like taking babies to see their
relations,&rdquo; Cyril said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed it
before&mdash;especially in their best things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I expect they pretend they&rsquo;re their own babies, and that
they&rsquo;re not servants at all, but
<PB ID="p39" N="39">
married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say the babies are the
little dukes and duchesses,&rdquo; Jane suggested dreamily, taking more
marmalade. &ldquo;I expect that&rsquo;s what Martha&rsquo;ll say to her
cousin. She&rsquo;ll enjoy herself most frightfully.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our
infant duke to Rochester,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;not if she&rsquo;s
anything like me&mdash;she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back! Oh,
crikey!&rdquo; said Cyril in full agreement.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going by carrier,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see them off, then we shall have done a polite and
kindly act, and we shall be quite sure we&rsquo;ve got rid of them for the
day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they did.</P>
<P>Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the
chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink cornflowers
and white ribbon. She had a yellow&hyphen;lace collar with a green bow. And
the Lamb had indeed his very best cream&hyphen;coloured silk coat and hat.
It was a smart party that the
<PB ID="p40" N="40">
carrier&rsquo;s cart picked up at the Cross Roads. When its white tilt and
red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl of chalkdust&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And now for the Sammyadd!&rdquo; said Cyril, and off they
went.</P>
<P>As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for. Although they
were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of the
gravel&hyphen;pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had
been carts. They had made a ring of stones round the place where the
Sand&hyphen;fairy had disappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun
was burning and bright, and the sky was deep blue&mdash;without a cloud.
The sand was very hot to touch.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;suppose it was only a dream, after all,&rdquo; Robert
said as the boys uncovered their spades from the sand&hyphen;heap where
they had buried them and began to dig.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose you were a sensible chap,&rdquo; said Cyril;
&ldquo;one&rsquo;s quite as likely as the other!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head,&rdquo; Robert
snapped.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose we girls take a turn,&rdquo; said Jane,
<PB ID="p41" N="41">
laughing. &ldquo;You boys seem to be getting very warm.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose you don&rsquo;t come shoving your silly oar in,&rdquo;
said Robert, who was now warm indeed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anthea quickly. &ldquo;Robert dear,
don&rsquo;t be so grumpy&mdash;we won&rsquo;t say a word, you shall be the
one to speak to the Fairy and tell him what we&rsquo;ve decided to wish
for. You&rsquo;ll say it much better than we shall.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose you drop being a little humbug,&rdquo; said Robert, but
not crossly. &ldquo;Look out&mdash;dig with your hands, now!&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they did, and presently uncovered the spider&hyphen;shaped brown
hairy body, long arms and legs, bat&rsquo;s ear and snail&rsquo;s eyes of
the Sand&hyphen;fairy himself. Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction,
for now of course it couldn&rsquo;t have been a dream.</P>
<P>The Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your left whisker this morning?&rdquo; said Anthea
politely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nothing to boast of,&rdquo; said it; &ldquo;it had rather a
restless night. But thank you for asking.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p42" N="42">
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;do you feel up to giving wishes
to&hyphen;day, because we very much want an extra besides the regular one?
The extra&rsquo;s a very little one,&rdquo; he added reassuringly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the Sand&hyphen;fairy. (If you read this story
aloud, please pronounce &ldquo;humph&rdquo; exactly as it is spelt, for
that is how he said it.) &ldquo;Humph! Do you know, until I heard you being
disagreeable to each other just over my head, and so loud too, I really
quite thought I had dreamed you all. I do have very odd dreams
sometimes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Jane hurried to say, so as to get away from the
subject of disagreeableness. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she added politely,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d tell us about your dreams&mdash;they must be awfully
interesting.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is that the day&rsquo;s wish?&rdquo; said the Sand&hyphen;fairy,
yawning.</P>
<P>Cyril muttered something about &ldquo;just like a girl,&rdquo; and the
rest stood silent. If they said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; then good&hyphen;bye to
the other wishes they had decided to ask for. If they said
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; it would be very rude, and they had all been
<PB ID="p43" N="43">
taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not at all the same
thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the Sand&hyphen;fairy
said&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If I do I shan&rsquo;t have strength to give you a second wish;
not even good tempers, or common sense, or manners, or little things like
that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to put yourself out at all about
<EMPH>these</EMPH> things, we can manage them quite well ourselves,&rdquo;
said Cyril eagerly; while the others looked guiltily at each other, and
wished the Fairy would not keep all on about good tempers, but give them
one good rowing if it wanted to, and then have done with it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Psammead, putting out his long
snail&rsquo;s eyes so suddenly that one of them nearly went into the round
boy&rsquo;s eye of Robert, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the little wish
first.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the servants to notice the gifts you give
us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are kind enough to give us,&rdquo; said Anthea in a whisper.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are kind enough to give us, I mean,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<PB ID="p44" N="44">
<P>The Fairy swelled himself out a bit, let his breath go, and
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done <EMPH>that</EMPH> for you&mdash;it was quite
easy. People don&rsquo;t notice things much, anyway. What&rsquo;s the next
wish?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We want,&rdquo; said Robert slowly, &ldquo;to be rich beyond the
dreams of something or other.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Avarice,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said the Fairy unexpectedly. &ldquo;But it
won&rsquo;t do you much good, that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; it muttered
to itself. &ldquo;Come &mdash;I can&rsquo;t go beyond dreams, you know! How
much do you want, and will you have it in gold or notes?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Gold, please&mdash;and millions of it.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;This gravel&hyphen;pit full be enough?&rdquo; said the Fairy in
an offhand manner.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh <EMPH>yes</EMPH>!&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then get out before I begin, or you&rsquo;ll be buried alive in
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that
the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts used
to come to the gravel&hyphen;pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough
to
<PB ID="pf45">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five045"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p45" N="45">
shout a timid &ldquo;Good&hyphen;morning, I hope your whisker will be
better to&hyphen;morrow,&rdquo; as she ran.</P>
<P>On the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their
eyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the sight
was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear it. It was something
like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day. For the whole
of the sand&hyphen;pit was full, right up to the very top, with new shining
gold pieces, and all the little sand&hyphen;martins&rsquo; little front
doors were covered out of sight. Where the road for the carts wound into
the gravel&hyphen;pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the
roadside, and a great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay
flat and smooth between the tall sides of the gravel&hyphen;pit. And all
the gleaming heap was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these
countless coins the midday sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed
till the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the
fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset.</P>
<PB ID="p46" N="46">
<P>The children stood with their mouths open, and no one said a word.</P>
<P>At last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the
edge of the heap by the cart&hyphen;road, and looked at it. He looked on
both sides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sovereigns.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold, anyway,&rdquo; said Cyril. And now they all
began to talk at once. They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls
and let it run through their fingers like water, and the chink it made as
it fell was wonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of
spending the money, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two
heaps of gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in
sand when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with
his newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she cried
out, &ldquo;Oh, stop, it&rsquo;s too heavy! It hurts!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert said &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; and went on.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let me out, I tell you,&rdquo; cried Jane, and was taken out,
very white, and trembling a little.</P>
<PB ID="p47" N="47">
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea what it&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like stones on you&mdash;or like chains.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Cyril said, &ldquo;if this is to do us any
good, it&rsquo;s no good our staying gasping at it like this. Let&rsquo;s
fill our pockets and go and buy things. Don&rsquo;t you forget, it
won&rsquo;t last after sunset. I wish we&rsquo;d asked the Sammyadd why
things don&rsquo;t turn to stone. Perhaps this will. I&rsquo;ll tell you
what, there&rsquo;s a pony and cart in the village.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you want to buy that?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, silly,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll <EMPH>hire</EMPH> it. And then
we&rsquo;ll go to Rochester and buy heaps and heaps of things. Look here,
let&rsquo;s each take as much as we can carry. But it&rsquo;s not
sovereigns. They&rsquo;ve got a man&rsquo;s head on one side and a thing
like the ace of spades on the other. Fill your pockets with it, I tell you,
and come along. You can jaw as we go&mdash;if you <EMPH>must</EMPH>
jaw.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril sat down and began to fill his pockets.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my
Norfolks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but now you see!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They did. For when Cyril had filled his
<PB ID="p48" N="48">
nine pockets and his handkerchief and the space between himself and his
shirt front with the gold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and
had to sit down again in a hurry.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Throw out some of the cargo,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sink the ship, old chap. That comes of nine
pockets.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And Cyril had to.</P>
<P>Then they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and
the road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and
hotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier.</P>
<P>It was Jane who said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re to spend
it all. There must be thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I&rsquo;m
going to leave some of mine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we
get to the village we&rsquo;ll buy some biscuits; I know it&rsquo;s long
past dinner&hyphen;time.&rdquo; She took out a handful or two of gold and
hid it in the hollows of an old hornbeam. &ldquo;How round and yellow they
are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish they were gingerbread
nuts and we were going to eat them?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="pf48">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five048"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p49" N="49">
<P>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re not, and we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</P>
<P>But they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village,
more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden
treasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas in
their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked quite
ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have more than a
half&hyphen;crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue of the
wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of the
village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench they came to. It
happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn.</P>
<P>It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for
ginger&hyphen;beer, because, as Anthea said, &ldquo;It is not wrong for men
to go into public houses, only for children. And Cyril is nearer to being a
man than us, because he is the eldest.&rdquo; So he went. The others sat in
the sun and waited.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, hats, how hot it is!&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Dogs put
their tongues out when they&rsquo;re hot; I
<PB ID="p50" N="50">
wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We might try,&rdquo; Jane said; and they all put their tongues
out as far as ever they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats,
but it only seemed to make them thirstier than ever, besides annoying
everyone who went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril
came back with the ginger&hyphen;beer.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I had to pay for it out of my own
two&hyphen;and&hyphen;sevenpence, though, that I was going to buy rabbits
with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t change the gold. And when
I pulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was
card&hyphen;counters. And I got some sponge&hyphen;cakes too, out of a
glass jar on the bar&hyphen;counter. And some biscuits with caraways
in.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The sponge&hyphen;cakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry
too, and yet soft, which biscuits ought not to be. But the
ginger&hyphen;beer made up for everything.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn now to try to buy something with the
money,&rdquo; Anthea said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m next eldest. Where is the
pony&hyphen;cart kept?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was at The Chequers, and Anthea went
<PB ID="pf50">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five050"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p51" N="51">
in the back way to the yard, because they all knew that little girls ought
not to go into the bars of public&hyphen;houses. She came out, as she
herself said, &ldquo;pleased but not proud&rdquo;.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be ready in a brace of shakes, he says,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s to have one sovereign&mdash;or whatever it
is&mdash;to drive us in to Rochester and back, besides waiting there till
we&rsquo;ve got everything we want. I think I managed very well.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You think yourself jolly clever, I daresay,&rdquo; said Cyril
moodily. &ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money
out of my pocket, to make it seem cheap, anyway,&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;I just found a young man doing something to a horse&rsquo;s leg with
a sponge and a pail. And I held out one sovereign, and I said, &lsquo;Do
you know what this is?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;d
call his father. And the old man came, and he said it was a spade guinea;
and he said was it my own to do as I liked with, and I said
&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;; and I asked about the pony&hyphen;cart, and I said he
could have the guinea if he&rsquo;d
<PB ID="p52" N="52">
drive us in to Rochester. And his name is S. Crispin. And he said,
&lsquo;Right oh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was a new sensation to be driven in a smart pony&hyphen;trap along
pretty country roads; it was very pleasant too (which is not always the
case with new sensations), quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending
the money which each child made as they went along, silently of course and
quite to itself, for they felt it would never have done to let the old
innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way they were thinking in.
The old man put them down by the bridge at their request.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you were going to buy a carriage and horses, where would you
go?&rdquo; asked Cyril, as if he were only asking for the sake of something
to say.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Billy Peasemarsh, at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; said the
old man promptly. &ldquo;Though all forbid I should recommend any man where
it&rsquo;s a question of horses, no more than I&rsquo;d take anybody
else&rsquo;s recommending if I was a&hyphen;buying one. But if your
pa&rsquo;s thinking of a turnout of any sort, there ain&rsquo;t a
straighter
<PB ID="p53" N="53">
man in Rochester, nor a civiller spoken, than Billy, though I says
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;The Saracen&rsquo;s
Head.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside
down and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown&hyphen;up person
would tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy
money had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was
almost impossible. The tradespeople of Rochester seemed to shrink, to a
trades&hyphen;person, from the glittering fairy gold (&ldquo;furrin
money&rdquo; they called it, for the most part). To begin with, Anthea, who
had had the misfortune to sit on her hat earlier in the day, wished to buy
another. She chose a very beautiful one, trimmed with pink roses and the
blue breasts of peacocks. It was marked in the window, &ldquo;Paris Model,
three guineas.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because, if it says
guineas, it means guineas, and not sovereigns, which we haven&rsquo;t
got.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But when she took three of the spade
<PB ID="p54" N="54">
guineas in her hand, which was by this time rather dirty owing to her not
having put on gloves before going to the gravel&hyphen;pit, the
black&hyphen;silk young lady in the shop looked very hard at her, and went
and whispered something to an older and uglier lady, also in black silk,
and then they gave her back the money and said it was not current coin.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good money,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
my own.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not the
kind of money that&rsquo;s fashionable now, and we don&rsquo;t care about
taking it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I believe they think we&rsquo;ve stolen it,&rdquo; said Anthea,
rejoining the others in the street; &ldquo;if we had gloves they
wouldn&rsquo;t think we were so dishonest. It&rsquo;s my hands being so
dirty fills their minds with doubts.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the
kind at sixpence three&hyphen;farthings, but when they offered a guinea the
woman looked at it through her spectacles and said she had no change; so
the gloves had to be paid for out of Cyril&rsquo;s
two&hyphen;and&hyphen;sevenpence that he meant to buy rabbits with,
<PB ID="p55" N="55">
and so had the green imitation crocodile&hyphen;skin purse at
ninepence&hyphen;halfpenny which had been bought at the same time. They
tried several more shops, the kinds where you buy toys and scent, and silk
handkerchiefs and books, and fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of
objects of interest in the vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea
that day in Rochester, and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier
and dirtier, and their hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and
fell down on a part of the road where a water&hyphen;cart had just gone by.
Also they got very hungry, but they found no one would give them anything
to eat for their guineas. After trying two pastry&hyphen;cooks in vain,
they became so hungry, perhaps from the smell of the cake in the shops, as
Cyril suggested, that they formed a plan of campaign in whispers and
carried it out in desperation. They marched into a third
pastry&hyphen;cook&rsquo;s&mdash;Beale his name was,&mdash;and before the
people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized three new
penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty hands, and taken a
big bite
<PB ID="p56" N="56">
out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood at bay, with the twelve buns in
their hands and their mouths very full indeed. The shocked
pastry&hyphen;cook bounded round the corner.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Cyril, speaking as distinctly as he could, and
holding out the guinea he got ready before entering the shop, &ldquo;pay
yourself out of that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it into his pocket.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Off you go,&rdquo; he said, brief and stern like the man in the
song.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But the change?&rdquo; said Anthea, who had a saving mind.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Change!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change you! Hout
you goes; and you may think yourselves lucky I don&rsquo;t send for the
police to find out where you got it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>In the Castle Gardens the millionaires finished the buns, and though the
curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a charm in
raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart quailed at
the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the
Saracen&rsquo;s Head on the subject of a horse and
<PB ID="pf56">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five056"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p57" N="57">
carriage. The boys would have given up the idea, but Jane was always a
hopeful child, and Anthea generally an obstinate one, and their earnestness
prevailed.</P>
<P>The whole party, by this time indescribably dirty, therefore betook
itself to the Saracen&rsquo;s Head. The yard&hyphen;method of attack having
been successful at The Chequers was tried again here. Mr. Peasemarsh was in
the yard, and Robert opened the business in these terms&mdash; </P>
<P>&ldquo;They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to
sell.&rdquo; It had been agreed that Robert should be spokesman, because in
books it is always the gentlemen who buy horses, and not ladies, and Cyril
had had his go at the Blue Boar.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They tell you true, young man,&rdquo; said Mr. Peasemarsh. He was
a long lean man, with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We should like to buy some, please,&rdquo; said Robert
politely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I daresay you would.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Will you show us a few, please? To choose from.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p58" N="58">
<P>&ldquo;Who are you a&hyphen;kidden of?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Billy
Peasemarsh. &ldquo;Was you sent here of a message?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;we want to buy some horses
and carriages, and a man told us you were straight and civil spoken, but I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he was mistaken.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Upon my sacred!&rdquo; said Mr. Peasemarsh. &ldquo;Shall I trot
the whole stable out for your Honour&rsquo;s worship to see? Or shall I
send round to the Bishop&rsquo;s to see of he&rsquo;s a nag or two to
dispose of?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s not too much
trouble. It would be very kind of you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Mr. Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed, and they did
not like the way he did it. Then he shouted &ldquo;Willum!&rdquo;</P>
<P>A stooping ostler appeared in a stable door.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, Willum, come and look at this &rsquo;ere young dook! Wants
to buy the whole stud, lock, stock, and bar&rsquo;l. And ain&rsquo;t got
tuppence in his pocket to bless hisself with, I&rsquo;ll go
bail!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Willum&rsquo;s eyes followed his master&rsquo;s pointing thumb with
contemptuous interest.</P>
<PB ID="p59" N="59">
<P>&ldquo;Do &rsquo;e, for sure?&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>But Robert spoke, though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket
and begging him to &ldquo;come along&rdquo;. He spoke, and he was very
angry; he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a young duke, and I never pretended to be. And as
for tuppence&mdash;what do you call this?&rdquo; And before the others
could stop him he had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas, and
held them out for Mr. Peasemarsh to look at. He did look. He snatched one
up in his finger and thumb. He bit it, and Jane expected him to say,
&ldquo;The best horse in my stables is at your service.&rdquo; But the
others knew better. Still it was a blow, even to the most desponding, when
he said shortly&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Willum, shut the yard doors,&rdquo; and Willum grinned and went
to shut them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good&hyphen;afternoon,&rdquo; said Robert hastily; &ldquo;we
shan&rsquo;t buy any of your horses now, whatever you say, and I hope
it&rsquo;ll be a lesson to you.&rdquo; He had seen a little side gate open,
and was moving towards it as he spoke. But Billy Peasemarsh put himself in
the way.</P>
<PB ID="p60" N="60">
<P>&ldquo;Not so fast, you young off&hyphen;scouring!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Willum, fetch the pleece.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Willum went. The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep,
and Mr. Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived. He said many
things. Among other things he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nice lot you are, aren&rsquo;t you, coming tempting honest men
with your guineas!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They <EMPH>are</EMPH> guineas,&rdquo; said Cyril boldly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, of course we don&rsquo;t know all about that, no more we
don&rsquo;t&mdash;oh no&mdash;course not! And dragging little gells into it
too. &rsquo;Ere&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let the gells go if you&rsquo;ll come
along to the pleece quiet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be let go,&rdquo; said Jane heroically; &ldquo;not
without the boys. It&rsquo;s our money just as much as theirs, you wicked
old man.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get it, then?&rdquo; said the man, softening
slightly, which was not at all what the boys expected when Jane began to
call names.</P>
<P>Jane cast a silent glance of agony at the others.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Lost your tongue, eh? Got it fast enough
<PB ID="p61" N="61">
when it&rsquo;s for calling names with. Come, speak up. Where&rsquo;d you
get it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Out of the gravel&hyphen;pit,&rdquo; said truthful Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Next article,&rdquo; said the man.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I tell you we did,&rdquo; Jane said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fairy
there&mdash;all over brown fur&mdash;with ears like a bat&rsquo;s and eyes
like a snail&rsquo;s, and he gives you a wish a day, and they all come
true.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Touched in the head, eh?&rdquo; said the man in a low voice,
&ldquo;all the more shame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child
into your sinful burglaries.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not mad; it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Anthea;
&ldquo;there <EMPH>is</EMPH> a fairy. If I ever see him again I&rsquo;ll
wish for something for you; at least I would if vengeance wasn&rsquo;t
wicked&mdash;so there!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; lumme,&rdquo; said Billy Peasemarsh, &ldquo;if there
ain&rsquo;t another on &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And now Willum came back, with a spiteful grin on his face, and at his
back a policeman, with whom Mr. Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse earnest
whisper.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said the policeman at last.
&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em up on a charge of unlawful
possession, pending inquiries. And
<PB ID="p62" N="62">
the magistrate will deal with the case. Send the afflicted ones to a home,
as likely as not, and the boys to a reformatory. Now then, come along,
youngsters! No use making a fuss. You bring the gells along, Mr.
Peasemarsh, sir, and I&rsquo;ll shepherd the boys.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Speechless with rage and horror, the four children were driven along the
streets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them, so that when
Robert ran right into a passer&hyphen;by he did not recognise her till a
well&hyphen;known voice said, &ldquo;Well, if ever I did. Oh, Master
Robert, whatever have you been a&hyphen;doing of now?&rdquo; And another
voice, quite as well known, said, &ldquo;Panty; want go own
Panty!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They had run into Martha and the baby!</P>
<P>Martha behaved admirably. She refused to believe a word of the
policeman&rsquo;s story, or of Mr. Peasemarsh&rsquo;s either, even when
they made Robert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the
guineas.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
gone out of your senses, you two! There ain&rsquo;t any gold
there&mdash;only the poor child&rsquo;s
<PB ID="pf62">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five062"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p63" N="63">
hands, all over crock and dirt, and like the very chimbley. Oh, that I
should ever see the day!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And the children thought this very noble of Martha, even if rather
wicked, till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the servants
should never notice any of the fairy gifts. So of course Martha
couldn&rsquo;t see the gold, and so was only speaking the truth, and that
was quite right, of course, but not extra noble.</P>
<P>It was getting dusk when they reached the police&hyphen;station. The
policeman told his tale to an inspector, who sat in a large bare room with
a thing like a clumsy nursery&hyphen;fender at one end to put prisoners in.
Robert wondered whether it was a cell or a dock.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Produce the coins, officer,&rdquo; said the inspector.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Turn out your pockets,&rdquo; said the constable.</P>
<P>Cyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets, stood still a
moment, and then began to laugh&mdash;an odd sort of laugh that hurt, and
that felt much more like crying. His pockets were empty. So were the
pockets of the
<PB ID="p64" N="64">
others. For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had vanished away.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Turn out your pockets, and stop that noise,&rdquo; said the
inspector.</P>
<P>Cyril turned out his pockets, every one of the nine which enriched his
Norfolk suit. And every pocket was empty.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the inspector.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they done it&mdash;artful little beggars!
They walked in front of me the &rsquo;ole way, so as for me to keep my eye
on them and not to attract a crowd and obstruct the traffic.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very remarkable,&rdquo; said the inspector,
frowning.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve quite done a&hyphen;browbeating of the innocent
children,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hire a private carriage and
we&rsquo;ll drive home to their papa&rsquo;s mansion. You&rsquo;ll hear
about this again young man!&mdash;I told you they hadn&rsquo;t got any
gold, when you were pretending to see it in their poor helpless hands.
It&rsquo;s early in the day for a constable on duty not to be able to trust
his own eyes. As to the other one, the less said the better; he keeps the
Saracen&rsquo;s
<PB ID="pf65">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five065"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p65" N="65">
Head, and he knows best what his liquor&rsquo;s like.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take them away, for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; said the
inspector crossly. But as they left the police&hyphen;station he said,
&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh, and he said it
twenty times as crossly as he had spoken to Martha.</P>
<P>*     *      *      *      *      *</P>
<P>Martha was as good as her word. She took them home in a very grand
carriage, because the carrier&rsquo;s cart was gone, and, though she had
stood by them so nobly with the police, she was so angry with them as soon
as they were alone for &ldquo;trapseing into Rochester by
themselves,&rdquo; that none of them dared to mention the old man with the
pony&hyphen;cart from the village who was waiting for them in Rochester.
And so, after one day of boundless wealth, the children found themselves
sent to bed in deep disgrace, and only enriched by two pairs of cotton
gloves, dirty inside because of the state of the hands they had been put on
to cover, an imitation crocodile&hyphen;skin purse, and twelve penny buns,
long since digested.</P>
<PB ID="p66" N="66">
<P>The thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old
gentleman&rsquo;s guinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the
rest, so they went down to the village next day to apologise for not
meeting him in Rochester, and to <EMPH>see</EMPH>. They found him very
friendly. The guinea had <EMPH>not</EMPH> disappeared, and he had bored a
hole in it and hung it on his watch&hyphen;chain. As for the guinea the
baker took, the children felt they <EMPH>could</EMPH> not care whether it
had vanished or not, which was not perhaps very honest, but on the other
hand was not wholly unnatural. But afterwards this preyed on Anthea&rsquo;s
mind, and at last she secretly sent twelve stamps by post to &ldquo;Mr.
Beale, Baker, Rochester.&rdquo; Inside she wrote, &ldquo;To pay for the
buns.&rdquo; I hope the guinea did disappear, for that pastry&hyphen;cook
was really not at all a nice man, and, besides, penny buns are seven for
sixpence in all really respectable shops.</P>

<PB ID="p67" N="67">
<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEING WANTED</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> morning after the children had been in possession of
boundless wealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or
enjoyable with it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an
imitation crocodile&hyphen;skin purse, and a ride in a pony&hyphen;cart,
they awoke without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on
the previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a
Psammead, or Sand&hyphen;fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a
new wish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and
neither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange things,
even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing than those
times when nothing happens but meals,
<PB ID="p68" N="68">
and they are not always completely pleasant, especially on the days when it
is cold mutton or hash.</P>
<P>There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because
everyone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and
determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for
breakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the
question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very difficult
to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend faithfully to
your baby brother&rsquo;s breakfast needs. The Baby was particularly lively
that morning. He not only wriggled his body through the bar of his high
chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but he collared a
tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on the head with
it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He put his fat fist
in his bread&hyphen;and&hyphen;milk, and demanded &ldquo;nam,&rdquo; which
was only allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table&mdash;he
clamoured to &ldquo;go walky&rdquo;. The conversation was something like
this&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p69" N="69">
<P>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;about that Sandy&hyphen;fairy&mdash;Look
out!&mdash;he&rsquo;ll have the milk over.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Milk removed to a safe distance.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;about that Fairy&mdash; No, Lamb dear, give Panther the
narky poon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then Cyril tried. &ldquo;Nothing we&rsquo;ve had yet has turned
out&mdash;He nearly had the mustard that time!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wonder whether we&rsquo;d better
wish&mdash;Hullo!&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it now, my boy!&rdquo; And, in a
flash of glass and pink baby&hyphen;paws, the bowl of golden carp in the
middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of mixed water
and goldfish into the Baby&rsquo;s lap and into the laps of the others.</P>
<P>Everyone was almost as much upset as the goldfish; the Lamb only
remaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the
leaping, gasping goldfish had been collected and put back in the water, the
Baby was taken away to be entirely re&hyphen;dressed by Martha, and most of
the others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had
been bathed in gold&hyphen;fish&hyphen;and&hyphen;water were hung out to
dry, and then it turned out that
<PB ID="p70" N="70">
Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day before or appear all
day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft and frilly, and trimmed
with lace, and very. very pretty, quite as pretty as a frock, if not more
so. Only it was <EMPH>not</EMPH> a frock, and Martha&rsquo;s word was law.
She wouldn&rsquo;t let Jane wear her best frock, and she refused to listen
for a moment to Robert&rsquo;s suggestion that Jane should wear her best
petticoat and call it a dress.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not respectable,&rdquo; she said. And when people say
that, it&rsquo;s no use anyone&rsquo;s saying anything. You will find this
out for yourselves some day.</P>
<P>So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had
been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High
Street of Rochester, just where a water&hyphen;cart had passed on its
silvery way. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than
grazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to the
knees and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as to
abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on
<PB ID="p71" N="71">
the grass&hyphen;plot round the sundial, and Jane darned away for dear
life. The Lamb was still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed,
so conversation was possible.</P>
<P>Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which
was that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Speak out&mdash;say what you&rsquo;ve got to say&mdash;I hate
hinting, and &lsquo;don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; and sneakish ways like
that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So then Robert said, as in honour bound&colon; &ldquo;Sneak
yourself&mdash;Anthea and me weren&rsquo;t so goldfishy as you two were, so
we got changed quicker, and we&rsquo;ve had time to think it over, and if
you ask me&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you,&rdquo; said Jane, biting off a needleful
of thread as she had always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you
don&rsquo;t know that if you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they
wind tight round your heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she
told me also about the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to
believe&mdash;what with nurses and science?)</P>
<PB ID="p72" N="72">
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who asks or who doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Robert, &ldquo;but Anthea and I think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If
it can give us our wishes I suppose it can give itself its own, and I feel
almost sure it wishes every time that our wishes shan&rsquo;t do us any
good. Let&rsquo;s let the tiresome beast alone, and just go and have a
jolly good game of forts, on our own, in the chalk&hyphen;pit.&rdquo;</P>
<P>(You will remember that the happily&hyphen;situated house where these
children were spending their holidays lay between a chalk&hyphen;quarry and
a gravel&hyphen;pit.)</P>
<P>Cyril and Jane were more hopeful&mdash;they generally were.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Sammyadd does it on purpose,&rdquo; Cyril
said; &ldquo;and, after all, it <EMPH>was</EMPH> silly to wish for
boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in two&hyphen;shilling pieces would have
been much more sensible. And wishing to be beautiful as the day was simply
donkeyish. I don&rsquo;t want to be disagreeable, but it <EMPH>was</EMPH>.
We must try to find a really useful wish, and wish it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane dropped her work and said&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p73" N="73">
<P>&ldquo;I think so too, it&rsquo;s too silly to have a chance like this
and not use it. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a
chance; there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that
wouldn&rsquo;t turn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do
let&rsquo;s think hard, and wish something nice, so that we can have a real
jolly day&mdash;what there is left of it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and
everyone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not
possibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were used
to talking &ldquo;by fours,&rdquo; as soldiers march, and each of them
could say what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable
sound of its own voice, and at the same time have three&hyphen;quarters of
two sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an
easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay you
can&rsquo;t do even that, I won&rsquo;t ask you to tell me whether &frac34;
&times; 2 = 1 &frac12;, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the
amount of ear each child
<PB ID="p74" N="74">
was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in Roman times, as
we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too instructive.</P>
<P>When the frock was darned, the start for the gravel&hyphen;pit was
delayed by Martha&rsquo;s insisting on everybody&rsquo;s washing its
hands&mdash;which was nonsense, because nobody had been doing anything at
all, except Jane, and how can you get dirty doing nothing? That is a
difficult question, and I cannot answer it on paper. In real life I could
very soon show you&mdash;or you me, which is much more likely.</P>
<P>During the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four
children, so <EMPH>that</EMPH> sum comes right), it had been decided that
fifty pounds in two&hyphen;shilling pieces was the right wish to have. And
the lucky children, who could have anything in the wide world by just
wishing for it, hurriedly started for the gravel&hyphen;pit to express
their wishes to the Psammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted
on their taking the Baby with them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not want him indeed! Why, everybody &rsquo;ud want him, a duck!
with all their hearts
<PB ID="pf74">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five074"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p75" N="75">
they would; and you know you promised your ma to take him out every blessed
day,&rdquo; said Martha.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know we did,&rdquo; said Robert in gloom, &ldquo;but I wish the
Lamb wasn&rsquo;t quite so young and small. It would be much better fun
taking him out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll mend of his youngness with time,&rdquo; said Martha;
&ldquo;and as for his smallness, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d fancy
carrying of him any more, however big he was. Besides he can walk a bit,
bless his precious fat legs, a ducky! He feels the benefit of the
new&hyphen;laid air, so he does, a pet!&rdquo;</P>
<P>With this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea&rsquo;s arms, and
went back to make new pinafores on the sewing&hyphen;machine. She was a
rapid performer on this instrument.</P>
<P>The Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, &ldquo;Walky wif Panty,&rdquo;
and rode on Robert&rsquo;s back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane
with stones, and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could
long be sorry that he was of the party.</P>
<P>The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that
<PB ID="p76" N="76">
they should devote a week&rsquo;s wishes to assuring the Baby&rsquo;s
future, by asking such gifts for him as the good fairies give to Infant
Princes in proper fairy&hyphen;tales, but Anthea soberly reminded her that
as the Sand&hyphen;fairy&rsquo;s wishes only lasted till sunset they could
not ensure any benefit to the Baby&rsquo;s later years; and Jane owned that
it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in two&hyphen;shilling pieces,
and buy the Lamb a three&hyphen;pound fifteen rocking&hyphen;horse, like
those in the Army and Navy Stores list, with part of the money.</P>
<P>It was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got
it, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again, taking
Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And they would
make a list of the things they really wanted before they started. Full of
high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe slow
cart&hyphen;road to the gravel&hyphen;pits, and as they went in between the
mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned their
ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book. Being real live
<PB ID="p77" N="77">
children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather blank
and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday, when they
had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was getting ready to
fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright guineas&mdash;millions of
them&mdash;it had told the children to run along outside the quarry for
fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid treasure. And they
had run. And so it happened that they had not had time to mark the spot
where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as before. And it was this
thought that put such silly expressions on their faces.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the hopeful Jane, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon
find him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and
they looked, and though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could they
find the Sand&hyphen;fairy.</P>
<P>At last they had to sit down and rest&mdash;not at all because they were
weary or disheartened of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being put
down, and you cannot
<PB ID="p78" N="78">
look very carefully after anything you may have happened to lose in the
sand if you have an active baby to look after at the same time. Get someone
to drop your best knife in the sand next time you go to the seaside, and
then take your baby brother with you when you go to look for it, and you
will see that I am right.</P>
<P>The Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country
air, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go on
talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found the
Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself.</P>
<P>He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into
Anthea&rsquo;s face, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand
and waved his fat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his
eyes, as it had into Anthea&rsquo;s, and he howled.</P>
<P>The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of
ginger&hyphen;beer with him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed
him. This had to be uncorked hurriedly&mdash;it was the only
<PB ID="p79" N="79">
wet thing within reach, and it was necessary to wash the sand out of the
Lamb&rsquo;s eyes somehow. Of course the ginger hurt horribly, and he
howled more than ever. And, amid his anguish of kicking, the bottle was
upset and the beautiful ginger&hyphen;beer frothed out into the sand and
was lost for ever.</P>
<P>It was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot
himself as to say&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don&rsquo;t; Martha
doesn&rsquo;t, not really, or she&rsquo;d jolly well keep him with her.
He&rsquo;s a little nuisance, that&rsquo;s what he is. It&rsquo;s too bad.
I only wish everybody <EMPH>did</EMPH> want him with all their hearts; we
might get some peace in our lives.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that
there is only one safe way of taking things out of little children&rsquo;s
eyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you
love the Baby as much as you ought to.</P>
<P>Then there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for
having been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either.
<PB ID="p80" N="80">
You often notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it
ought not to&mdash;and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one
who oughtn&rsquo;t to have said it is sorry.</P>
<P>The silence was broken by a sigh&mdash;a breath suddenly let out. The
children&rsquo;s heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each
nose, and someone had pulled all the strings at once.</P>
<P>And everyone saw the Sand&hyphen;fairy sitting quite close to them, with
the expression which it used as a smile on its hairy face.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good&hyphen;morning,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;I did that quite
easily! Everyone wants him now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Robert sulkily, because he
knew he had been behaving rather like a pig. &ldquo;No matter who wants
him&mdash;there&rsquo;s no one here to&mdash;anyhow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ingratitude,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;is a dreadful
vice.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not ungrateful,&rdquo; Jane made haste to say,
&ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t <EMPH>really</EMPH> want that wish. Robert only
just said it. Can&rsquo;t you take it back and give us a new
one?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Sand&hyphen;fairy said
shortly;
<PB ID="p81" N="81">
&ldquo;chopping and changing&mdash;it&rsquo;s not business. You ought to be
careful what you <EMPH>do</EMPH> wish. There was a little boy once,
he&rsquo;d wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an Ichthyosaurus, because
he was too lazy to remember the easy names of everyday things, and his
father had been very vexed with him, and had made him go to bed before
tea&hyphen;time, and wouldn&rsquo;t let him go out in the nice flint boat
along with the other children,&mdash;it was the annual school&hyphen;treat
next day,&mdash;and he came and flung himself down near me on the morning
of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs about and said he
wished he was dead. And of course then he was.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; said the children all together.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Only till sunset, of course,&rdquo; the Psammead said;
&ldquo;still it was quite enough for his father and mother. And he caught
it when he woke up&mdash;I can tell you. He didn&rsquo;t turn to
stone&mdash;I forget why&mdash;but there must have been some reason. They
didn&rsquo;t know being dead is only being asleep, and you&rsquo;re bound
to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep or in some
better place. You may be
<PB ID="p82" N="82">
sure he caught it, giving them such a turn. Why, he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to
taste Megatherium for a month after that. Nothing but oysters and
periwinkles, and common things like that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale. They looked
at the Psammead in horror. Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something brown
and furry was near him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Poof, poof, poofy,&rdquo; he said, and made a grab.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a pussy,&rdquo; Anthea was beginning, when the
Sand&hyphen;fairy leaped back.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, my left whisker!&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let him
touch me. He&rsquo;s wet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Its fur stood on end with horror&mdash;and indeed a good deal of the
ginger&hyphen;beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb.</P>
<P>The Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and
a whirl of sand.</P>
<P>The children marked the spot with a ring of stones.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We may as well get along home,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m sorry; but anyway if it&rsquo;s no good
it&rsquo;s no harm, and we know where the sandy thing is for
to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="pf82">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five082"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p83" N="83">
<P>The others were noble. No one reproached Robert at all. Cyril picked up
the Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe
cart&hyphen;road.</P>
<P>The cart&hyphen;road from the gravel&hyphen;pits joins the road almost
directly.</P>
<P>At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from
Cyril&rsquo;s back to Robert&rsquo;s. And as they paused a very smart open
carriage came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside
the carriage a lady&mdash;very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace
and red ribbons and a parasol all red and white&mdash;and a white fluffy
dog on her lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the
children, and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children
were used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a
&ldquo;very taking child&rdquo;. So they waved their hands politely to the
lady and expected her to drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the
coachman stop. And she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the
carriage she said&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a dear darling duck of a baby!
<PB ID="p84" N="84">
Oh, I <EMPH>should</EMPH> so like to adopt it! Do you think its mother
would mind?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d mind very much indeed,&rdquo; said Anthea
shortly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know. I am Lady
Chittenden. You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers.
They call me a Beauty, you know, but of course that&rsquo;s all nonsense.
Anyway&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>She opened the carriage door and jumped out. She had the wonderfullest
red high&hyphen;heeled shoes with silver buckles. &ldquo;Let me hold him a
minute,&rdquo; she said. And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly,
as if she was not used to babies.</P>
<P>Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and
slammed the door and said, &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman
hesitated.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Drive on, I tell you!&rdquo; cried the lady; and the coachman
did, for, as he said afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not
to.</P>
<P>The four children looked at each other, and
<PB ID="pf85">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five085"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p85" N="85">
then with one accord they rushed after the carriage and held on behind.
Down the dusty road went the smart carriage, and after it, at
double&hyphen;quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the Lamb&rsquo;s
brothers and sisters.</P>
<P>The Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by
slow degree to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still and they knew he had
gone to sleep.</P>
<P>The carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the dust
were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at the lodge
of a grand park. The children crouched down behind the carriage, and the
lady got out. She looked at the Baby as it lay on the carriage seat, and
hesitated.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The darling&mdash;I won&rsquo;t disturb it,&rdquo; she said, and
went into the lodge to talk to the woman there about a setting of Buff
Orpington eggs that had not turned out well.</P>
<P>The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping
Lamb.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fine boy&mdash;wish he was mine,&rdquo; said the coachman.</P>
<PB ID="p86" N="86">
<P>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t favour <EMPH>you</EMPH> much,&rdquo; said the
groom sourly; &ldquo;too &rsquo;andsome.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The coachman pretended not to hear. He said&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wonder at her now&mdash;I do really! Hates kids. Got none of her
own, and can&rsquo;t abide other folkses&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children, crouching in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged
uncomfortable glances.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; the coachman went on firmly, &ldquo;blowed
if I don&rsquo;t hide the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his
brothers took &rsquo;im! Then I&rsquo;ll come back for him
afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the footman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
took to that kid so as never was. If anyone&rsquo;s to have him, it&rsquo;s
me&mdash;so there!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Stow your gab!&rdquo; the coachman rejoined. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t want no kids, and, if you did, one kid&rsquo;s the same as
another to you. But I&rsquo;m a married man and a judge of breed. I knows a
firstrate yearling when I sees him. I&rsquo;m a&hyphen;goin&rsquo; to
&rsquo;ave him, an&rsquo; least said soonest mended.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="pf87">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five087"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p87" N="87">
<P>&ldquo;I should &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought,&rdquo; said the footman
sneeringly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d a&rsquo;most enough. What with Alfred,
an&rsquo; Albert, an&rsquo; Louise, an&rsquo; Victor Stanley, and Helena
Beatrice, an another&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>The coachman hit the footman in the chin&mdash;the footman hit the
coachman in the waistcoat&mdash;the next minute the two were fighting here
and there, in and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little
dog jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad.</P>
<P>Cyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of
the carriage farthest from the battlefield. He unfastened the door of the
carriage&mdash;the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel to
notice anything&mdash;took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping,
carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile led
into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and young oaks
and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong&hyphen;scented bracken, they
all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were hushed at the angry
voice of the red&hyphen;and&hyphen;white lady, and, after a
<PB ID="p88" N="88">
long and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.</P>
<P>&ldquo;My only hat!&rdquo; said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the
sound of wheels at last died away. &ldquo;Everyone <EMPH>does</EMPH> want
him now&mdash;and no mistake! That Sammyadd has done us again! Tricky
brute! For any sake, let&rsquo;s get the kid safe home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white
road, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage, and
the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb.</P>
<P>Adventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his
back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby, and
then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way twice.
They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert
couldn&rsquo;t make him go away till they had more than once invited him to
smell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a
blue&hyphen;and&hyphen;white checked pinafore actually followed them for a
quarter of a mile crying for &ldquo;the precious Baby,&rdquo; and then she
<PB ID="p89" N="89">
was only got rid of by threats of tying her to a tree in the wood with all
their pocket&hyphen;handkerchiefs. &ldquo;So that the bears can come and
eat you as soon as it gets dark,&rdquo; said Cyril severely. Then she went
off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the brothers and sisters of the
Baby, who was wanted by everyone, to hide in the hedge whenever they saw
anyone coming, and thus they managed to prevent the Lamb from arousing the
inconvenient affection of a milk&hyphen;man, a stone&hyphen;breaker, and a
man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at the back of it. They were
nearly home when the worst thing of all happened. Turning a corner suddenly
they came upon two vans, a tent, and a company of gipsies encamped by the
side of the road. The vans were hung all round with wicker chairs and
cradles, and flower&hyphen;stands and feather brushes. A lot of ragged
children were industriously making dust&hyphen;pies in the road, two men
lay on the grass smoking, and three women were doing the family washing in
an old red watering&hyphen;can with the top broken off.</P>
<P>In a moment every gipsy, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and
the Baby.</P>
<PB ID="p90" N="90">
<P>&ldquo;Let me hold him, little lady,&rdquo; said one of the gipsy women,
who had a mahogany&hyphen;coloured face and dust&hyphen;coloured hair;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt a hair of his head, the little
picture!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let <EMPH>me</EMPH> have him,&rdquo; said the other woman, whose
face was also of the hue of mahogany, and her hair jet&hyphen;black, in
greasy curls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nineteen of my own, so I
have.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it
nearly choked her.</P>
<P>Then one of the men pushed forward.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Swelp me if it ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my own
long&hyphen;lost child! Have he a strawberry mark on his left ear? No? Then
he&rsquo;s my own baby, stolen from me in hinnocent hinfancy. &rsquo;And
&rsquo;im over&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll not &rsquo;ave the law on yer this
time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into
tears of pure rage.</P>
<P>The others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible
thing that had ever happened to them. Even being taken up by the police in
Rochester was nothing to this. Cyril was quite white, and his hands
trembled
<PB ID="pf90">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five090"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p91" N="91">
a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up. He was silent a
minute, thinking hard. Then he said&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to keep him if he&rsquo;s yours. But you see
he&rsquo;s used to us. You shall have him if you want
him.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no !&rdquo; cried Anthea&mdash;and Cyril glared at her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course we want him,&rdquo; said the woman, trying to get the
Baby out of the man&rsquo;s arms. The Lamb howled loudly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; shrieked Anthea; and Cyril, in a
savage undertone, bade her &ldquo;stow it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You trust to me,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s awfully tiresome with people he doesn&rsquo;t
know very well. Suppose we stay here a bit till he gets used to you, and
then when it&rsquo;s bedtime I give you my word of honour we&rsquo;ll go
away and let you keep him if you want to. And then when we&rsquo;re gone
you can decide which of you is to have him, as you all want him so
much.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; said the man who was holding the
Baby, trying to loosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold
<PB ID="p92" N="92">
of and drawn round his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly
breathe. The gipsies whispered together, and Cyril took the chance to
whisper too. He said, &ldquo;Sunset! we&rsquo;ll get away then.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration
at his having been so clever as to remember this.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, do let him come to us;&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;See,
we&rsquo;ll sit down here and take care of him for you till he gets used to
you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What about dinner?&rdquo; said Robert suddenly. The others looked
at him with scorn. &ldquo;Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when
your br&mdash;I mean when the Baby&rdquo;&mdash;Jane whispered hotly.
Robert carefully winked at her and went on&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind my just running home to get our
dinner?&rdquo; he said to the gipsies; &ldquo;I can bring it out here in a
basket.&rdquo;</P>
<P>His brothers and sisters felt themselves very noble, and despised him.
They did not know his thoughtful secret intention. But the gipsies did in a
minute.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;and then fetch the
<PB ID="p93" N="93">
police with a pack of lies about it being your baby instead of ours !
D&rsquo;jever catch a weasel asleep?&rdquo; they asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re hungry you can pick a bit along of us,&rdquo;
said the light&hyphen;haired gipsy woman, not unkindly. &ldquo;Here Levi,
that blessed kid&rsquo;ll howl all his buttons off. Give him to the little
lady, and let&rsquo;s see if they can&rsquo;t get him used to us a
bit.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So the Lamb was handed back; but the gipsies crowded so closely that he
could not possibly stop howling. Then the man with the red handkerchief
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, Pharaoh, make up the fire; and you girls see to the pot.
Give the kid a chanst.&rdquo; So the gipsies, very much against their will,
went off to their work, and the children and the Lamb were left sitting on
the grass.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right at sunset,&rdquo; Jane whispered.
&ldquo;But, oh, it is awful! Suppose they are frightfully angry when they
come to their senses! They might beat us, or leave us tied to trees, or
something.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Anthea said. (&ldquo;Oh, my Lamb,
don&rsquo;t cry any more, it&rsquo;s all right, Panty&rsquo;s
<PB ID="p94" N="94">
got oo, duckie!&rdquo;) &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t unkind people, or they
wouldn&rsquo;t be going to give us any dinner.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch their
nasty dinner. It would choke me!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others thought so too then. But when the dinner was ready&mdash;it
turned out to be supper, and happened between four and five&mdash;they were
all glad enough to take what they could get. It was boiled rabbit, with
onions, and some bird rather like a chicken, but stringier about its legs
and with a stronger taste. The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown
sugar sprinkled on the top. He liked this very much, and consented to let
the two gipsy women feed him with it, as he sat on Anthea&rsquo;s lap. All
that long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep
the Lamb amused and happy, while the gipsies looked eagerly on. By the time
the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really
&ldquo;taken to&rdquo; the woman with the light hair, and even consented to
kiss his hand to the children, and to stand up and bow, with his hand on
his chest&mdash;
<PB ID="pf94">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five094"></FIGURE>

&ldquo;like a gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;to the two men. The whole gipsy camp
was in raptures with him, and his brothers and sisters could not help
taking some pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so
interested and enthusiastic. But they longed for sunset.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting into the habit of longing for sunset,&rdquo;
Cyril whispered. &ldquo;How I do wish we could wish something really
sensible, that would be of some use, so that we should be quite sorry when
sunset came.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The shadows got longer and longer, and at last there were no separate
shadows any more, but one soft glowing shadow over everything; for the sun
was out of sight&mdash;behind the hill&mdash;but he had not really set yet.
The people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people
who decide when the sun sets; she has to do it, too, to the minute, or they
would know the reason why!</P>
<P>But the gipsies were getting impatient.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now, young uns,&rdquo; the red&hyphen;handkerchief man said,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s time you were laying of your heads on your
pillows&mdash;so it is! The kid&rsquo;s all right and friendly with us
now&mdash;so you
<PB ID="p96" N="96">
just hand him over and sling that hook o&rsquo; yours like you
said.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The women and children came crowding round the Lamb, arms were held out,
fingers snapped invitingly, friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles;
but all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb. He clung with arms and legs to
Jane, who happened to be holding him, and uttered the gloomiest roar of the
whole day.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;hand the little
poppet over, miss. We&rsquo;ll soon quiet him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And still the sun would not set.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell her about how to put him to bed,&rdquo; whispered Cyril;
&ldquo;anything to gain time&mdash;and be ready to bolt when the sun really
does make up its silly old mind to set.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll hand him over in just one minute,&rdquo; Anthea
began, talking very fast &mdash;&ldquo;but do let me just tell you he has a
warm bath every night and cold in the morning, and he has a crockery rabbit
to go into the warm bath with him, and little Samuel saying his prayers in
white china on a red cushion for the cold bath;
<PB ID="p97" N="97">
and he hates you to wash his ears, but you must; and if you let the soap
get into his eyes, the Lamb&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Lamb kyes,&rdquo; said he&mdash;he had stopped roaring to
listen.</P>
<P>The woman laughed. &ldquo;As if I hadn&rsquo;t never bath&rsquo;d a
babby!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come&mdash;give us a hold of him. Come to
&rsquo;Melia, my precious.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;G&rsquo;way, ugsie!&rdquo; replied the Lamb at once.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; Anthea went on, &ldquo;about his meals; you
really <EMPH>must</EMPH> let me tell you he has an apple or a banana every
morning, and bread&hyphen;and&hyphen;milk for breakfast, and an egg for his
tea sometimes, and&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought up ten,&rdquo; said the black&hyphen;ringleted
woman, &ldquo;besides the others. Come, miss, &rsquo;and &rsquo;im
over&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it no longer. I just must give him a
hug.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t settled yet whose he&rsquo;s to be, Esther,&rdquo;
said one of the men.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be you, Esther, with seven of &rsquo;em at your
tail a&rsquo;ready.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure of that,&rdquo; said Esther&rsquo;s
husband.</P>
<PB ID="p98" N="98">
<P>&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t I nobody, to have a say neither?&rdquo; said the
husband of &rsquo;Melia.</P>
<P>Zillah, the girl, said, &ldquo;An&rsquo; me? I&rsquo;m a single
girl&mdash;and no one but &rsquo;im to look after&mdash;I ought to have
him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shut your mouth!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you show me no more of your impudence!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Everyone was getting very angry. The dark gipsy faces were frowning and
anxious&hyphen;looking. Suddenly a change swept over them, as if some
invisible sponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions, and
left only a blank.</P>
<P>The children saw that the sun really <EMPH>had</EMPH> set. But they were
afraid to move. And the gipsies were feeling so muddled, because of the
invisible sponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out
of their hearts, that they could not say a word.</P>
<P>The children hardly dared to breathe. Suppose the gipsies, when they
recovered speech, should be furious to think how silly they had been all
day?</P>
<PB ID="p99" N="99">
<P>It was an awkward moment. Suddenly Anthea, greatly daring, held out the
Lamb to the red&hyphen;handkerchief man.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>The man drew back. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to deprive you
miss,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Anyone who likes can have my share of him,&rdquo; said the other
man.</P>
<P>&ldquo;After all, I&rsquo;ve got enough of my own,&rdquo; said
Esther.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice little chap, though,&rdquo; said Amelia. She
was the only one who now looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb.</P>
<P>Zillah said, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t think I must have had a touch of
the sun. <EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then shall we take him away?&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well&mdash;suppose you do,&rdquo; said Pharaoh heartily,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll say no more about it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents
for the night. All but Amelia. She went with the children as far as the
bend in the road&mdash;and there she said&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let me give him a kiss, miss&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
<PB ID="p100" N="100">
know what made us go for to behave so silly. Us gipsies don&rsquo;t steal
babies, whatever they may tell you when you&rsquo;re naughty. We&rsquo;ve
enough of our own, mostly. But I&rsquo;ve lost all mine.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She leaned towards the Lamb; and he, looking in her eyes, unexpectedly
put up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Poor, poor!&rdquo; said the Lamb. And he let the gipsy woman kiss
him, and, what is more, he kissed her brown cheek in return&mdash;a very
nice kiss, as all his kisses are, and not a wet one like some babies give.
The gipsy woman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been
writing something there, and the same with his chest and his hands and his
feet; then she said&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;May he be brave, and have the strong head to think with, and the
strong heart to love with, and the strong hands to work with, and the
strong feet to travel with, and always come safe home to his own.&rdquo;
Then she said something in a strange language no one could understand, and
suddenly added&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, I must be saying &lsquo;so long&rsquo;&mdash;and
<PB ID="pf100">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five100"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p101" N="101">
glad to have made your acquaintance.&rdquo; And she turned and went back to
her home&mdash;the tent by the grassy roadside.</P>
<P>The children looked after her till she was out of sight. Then Robert
said, &ldquo;How silly of her! Even sunset didn&rsquo;t put
<EMPH>her</EMPH> right. What rot she talked!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;if you ask me, I think it was
rather decent of her&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Decent?&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;it was very nice indeed of
her. I think she&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just too frightfully nice for anything,&rdquo; said
Jane.</P>
<P>And they went home&mdash;very late for tea and unspeakably late for
dinner. Martha scolded, of course. But the Lamb was safe.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say&mdash;it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as
anyone,&rdquo; said Robert later.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But do you feel different about it now the sun&rsquo;s
set?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>No</EMPH>,&rdquo; said all the others together.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s lasted over sunset with us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cyril explained. &ldquo;The wish
didn&rsquo;t do anything to <EMPH>us</EMPH>. We always wanted
<PB ID="p102" N="102">
him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves, only we were all
pigs this morning; especially you, Robert.&rdquo; Robert bore this much
with a strange calm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I certainly <EMPH>thought</EMPH> I didn&rsquo;t want him this
morning,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Perhaps I <EMPH>was</EMPH> a pig. But
everything looked so different when we thought we were going to lose
him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And that, my dear children, is the moral of this chapter. I did not mean
it to have a moral, but morals are nasty forward beings, and will keep
shoving their oars in where they are not wanted. And since the moral has
sneaked in, quite against my wishes, you might as well think of it next
time you feel piggy yourself and want to get rid of any of your brothers
and sisters. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t often happen, but I daresay it has
happened sometimes, even to you!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WINGS</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> next day was very wet&mdash;too wet to go out, and far too
wet to think of disturbing a Sand&hyphen;fairy so sensitive to water that
he still, after thousands of years, felt the pain of once having had his
left whisker wetted. It was a long day, and it was not till the afternoon
that all the children suddenly decided to write letters to their mother. It
was Robert who had the misfortune to upset the ink&hyphen;pot&mdash;an
unusually deep and full one&mdash; straight into that part of
Anthea&rsquo;s desk where she had long pretended that an arrangement of gum
and cardboard painted with Indian ink was a secret drawer. It was not
exactly Robert&rsquo;s fault; it was only his misfortune that he chanced to
be lifting the ink across the desk just at the moment when Anthea had got
it open, and that
<PB ID="p104" N="104">
that same moment should have been the one chosen by the Lamb to get under
the table and break his squeaking bird. There was a sharp convenient wire
inside the bird, and of course the Lamb ran the wire into Robert&rsquo;s
leg at once; and so, without anyone&rsquo;s meaning to, the secret drawer
was flooded with ink. At the same time a stream was poured over
Anthea&rsquo;s half&hyphen;finished letter.</P>
<P>So that her letter was something like this&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;DARLING MOTHER, I hope you are quite well, and I hope Granny is
better. The other day we . . .&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then came a flood of ink, and at the bottom these words in
pencil&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It was not me upset the ink, but it took such a time clearing up,
so no more as it is post&hyphen;time. From your loving daughter,</P>
<P>&ldquo;ANTHEA.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert&rsquo;s letter had not even been begun. He had been drawing a
ship on the blotting paper while he was trying to think of what to say. And
of course after the ink was upset
<PB ID="p105" N="105">
he had to help Anthea to clean out her desk, and he promised to make her
another secret drawer, better than the other. And she said, &ldquo;Well,
make it now.&rdquo; So it was post&hyphen;time and his letter wasn&rsquo;t
done. And the secret drawer wasn&rsquo;t done either.</P>
<P>Cyril wrote a long letter, very fast, and then went to set a trap for
slugs that he had read about in the <BIBL>Home&hyphen;made Gardener</BIBL>,
and when it was post&hyphen;time the letter could not be found, and it
never was found. Perhaps the slugs ate it.</P>
<P>Jane&rsquo;s letter was the only one that went. She meant to tell her
mother all about the Psammead&mdash;in fact they had all meant to do
this&mdash;but she spent so long thinking how to spell the word that there
was no time to tell the story properly, and it is useless to tell a story
unless you <EMPH>do</EMPH> tell it properly, so she had to be contented
with this&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;MY DEAR MOTHER DEAR,&mdash;We are all as good as we can, like you
told us to, and the Lamb has a little cold, but Martha says it is nothing,
only he upset the gold&hyphen;fish into
<PB ID="p106" N="106">
himself yesterday morning. When we were up at the sand&hyphen;pit the other
day we went round by the safe way where the carts go, and we found
a&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>Half an hour went by before Jane felt quite sure that they could none of
them spell Psammead. And they could not find it in the dictionary either,
though they looked. Then Jane hastily finished her letter&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We found a strange thing, but it is nearly post&hyphen;time, so
no more at present from your little girl,</P>
<P>&ldquo;JANE.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;P.S. If you could have a wish come true, what would you
have?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then the postman was heard blowing his horn, and Robert rushed out in
the rain to stop his cart and give him the letters. And that was how it
happened that, though all the children meant to tell their mother about the
Sand&hyphen;fairy, somehow or other she never got to know. There were other
reasons why she never got to know, but these come later.</P>
<P>The next day Uncle Richard came and took
<PB ID="p107" N="107">
them all to Maidstone in a waggonette&mdash;all except the Lamb. Uncle
Richard was the very best kind of uncle. He bought them toys at Maidstone.
He took them into a shop and let them choose exactly what they wanted,
without any restrictions about price, and no nonsense about things being
instructive. It is very wise to let children choose exactly what they like,
because they are very foolish and inexperienced, and sometimes they will
choose a really instructive thing without meaning to. This happened to
Robert, who chose, at the last moment, and in a great hurry, a box with
pictures on it of winged bulls with men&rsquo;s heads and winged men with
eagles&rsquo; heads. He thought there would be animals inside, the same as
on the box. When he got it home it was a Sunday puzzle about ancient
Nineveh! The others chose in haste, and were happy at leisure. Cyril had a
model engine, and the girls had two dolls, as well as a china
tea&hyphen;set with forget&hyphen;me&hyphen;nots on it, to be
&ldquo;between them.&rdquo; The boys&rsquo; &ldquo;between them&rdquo; was
bow and arrows.</P>
<PB ID="p108" N="108">
<P>Then Uncle Richard took them on the beautiful Medway in a boat, and then
they all had tea at a beautiful pastry&hyphen;cook&rsquo;s, and when they
reached home it was far too late to have any wishes that day.</P>
<P>They did not tell Uncle Richard anything about the Psammead. I do not
know why. And they do not know why. But I daresay you can guess.</P>
<P>The day after Uncle Richard had behaved so handsomely was a very hot day
indeed. The people who decide what the weather is to be, and puts its
orders down for it in the newspapers every morning, said afterwards that it
was the hottest day there had been for years. They had ordered it to be
&ldquo;warmer&mdash;some showers,&rdquo; and warmer it certainly was. In
fact it was so busy being warmer that it had no time to attend to the order
about showers, so there weren&rsquo;t any.</P>
<P>Have you ever been up at five o&rsquo;clock on a fine summer morning? It
is very beautiful. The sunlight is pinky and yellowy, and all the grass and
trees are covered with dew&hyphen;diamonds. And all the shadows go the
opposite way to
<PB ID="p109" N="109">
the way they do in the evening, which is very interesting and makes you
feel as though you were in a new other world.</P>
<P>Anthea awoke at five. She had made herself wake, and I must tell you how
it is done, even if it keeps you waiting for the story to go on.</P>
<P>You get into bed at night, and lie down quite flat on your little back,
with your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say &ldquo;I
<EMPH>must</EMPH> wake up at five&rdquo; (or six, or seven, or eight, or
nine, or whatever the time is that you want), and as you say it you push
your chin down on to your chest and then bang your head back on the pillow.
And you do this as many times as there are ones in the time you want to
wake up at. (It is quite an easy sum.) Of course everything depends on your
really wanting to get up at five (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine); if
you don&rsquo;t really want to, it&rsquo;s all of no use. But if you
do&mdash;well, try it and see. Of course in this, as in doing Latin proses
or getting into mischief, practice makes perfect.</P>
<P>Anthea was quite perfect.</P>
<PB ID="p110" N="110">
<P>At the very moment when she opened her eyes she heard the
black&hyphen;and&hyphen;gold clock down in the dining&hyphen;room strike
eleven. So she knew it was three minutes to five. The
black&hyphen;and&hyphen;gold clock always struck wrong, but was all right
when you knew what it meant. It was like a person talking a foreign
language. If you know the language it is just as easy to understand as
English. And Anthea knew the clock language. She was very sleepy, but she
jumped out of bed and put her face and hands into a basin of cold water.
This is a fairy charm that prevents your wanting to get back into bed
again. Then she dressed, and folded up her nightgown. She did not tumble it
together by the sleeves, but folded it by the seams from the hem, and that
will show you the kind of well&hyphen;brought&hyphen;up little girl she
was.</P>
<P>Then she took her shoes in her hand and crept softly down the stairs.
She opened the dining&hyphen;room window and climbed out. It would have
been just as easy to go out by the door, but the window was more romantic,
and less likely to be noticed by Martha.</P>
<PB ID="pf111">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five111"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p111" N="111">
<P>&ldquo;I will always get up at five,&rdquo; she said to herself.
&ldquo;It was quite too awfully pretty for anything.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Her heart was beating very fast, for she was carrying out a plan quite
her own. She could not be sure that it was a good plan, but she was quite
sure that it would not be any better if she were to tell the others about
it. And she had a feeling that, right or wrong, she would rather go through
with it alone. She put on her shoes under the iron verandah, on the
red&hyphen;and&hyphen;yellow shining tiles, and then she ran straight to
the sand&hyphen;pit, and found the Psammead&rsquo;s place, and dug it out;
it was very cross indeed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; it said, fluffing up its fur like
pigeons do their feathers at Christmas time. &ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s
arctic, and it&rsquo;s the middle of the night.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Anthea gently, and she took off
her white pinafore and covered the Sand&hyphen;fairy up with it, all but
its head, its bat&rsquo;s ears, and its eyes that were like a snail&rsquo;s
eyes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s better.
What&rsquo;s the wish this morning?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p112" N="112">
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it.
You see we&rsquo;ve been very unlucky, so far. I wanted to talk to you
about it. But&mdash;would you mind not giving me any wishes till after
breakfast? It&rsquo;s so hard to talk to anyone if they jump out at you
with wishes you don&rsquo;t really want!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t say you wish for things if you don&rsquo;t
wish for them. In the old days people almost always knew whether it was
Megatherium or Ichthyosaurus they really wanted for dinner.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;but I do
wish&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; said the Psammead in a warning voice, and it
began to blow itself out.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, this isn&rsquo;t a magic wish&mdash;it&rsquo;s just&mdash;I
should be go glad if you&rsquo;d not swell yourself out and nearly burst to
give me any thing just now. Wait till the others are here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; it said indulgently, but it shivered.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Would you,&rdquo; asked Anthea kindly&mdash; &ldquo;would you
like to come and sit on my lap? You&rsquo;d be warmer, and I could turn the
<PB ID="p113" N="113">
skirt of my frock up round you. I&rsquo;d be very careful.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea had never expected it would, but it did.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;you really are rather
thoughtful.&rdquo; It crept on to her lap and snuggled down, and she put
her arms round it with a rather frightened gentleness. &ldquo;Now
then!&rdquo; it said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;everything we have wished
has turned out rather horrid. I wish you would advise us. You are so old,
you must be very wise.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I was always generous from a child,&rdquo; said the
Sand&hyphen;fairy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent the whole of my waking hours in
giving. But one thing I won&rsquo;t give&mdash;that&rsquo;s
advice.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Anthea went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a
wonderful thing&mdash;such a splendid, glorious chance. It&rsquo;s so good
and kind and dear of you to give us our wishes, and it seems such a pity it
should all be wasted just because we are too silly to know what to wish
for.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea had meant to say that&mdash; and she had not wanted to say it
before the others.
<PB ID="p114" N="114">
It&rsquo;s one thing to say you&rsquo;re silly, and quite another to say
that other people are.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said the Sand&hyphen;fairy sleepily, &ldquo;I can
only advise you to think before you speak&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But I thought you never gave advice.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That piece doesn&rsquo;t count,&rdquo; it said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never take it! Besides, it&rsquo;s not original.
It&rsquo;s in all the copy&hyphen;books.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you just say if you think wings would be a silly
wish?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wings?&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I should think you might do worse.
Only, take care you aren&rsquo;t flying high at sunset. There was a little
Ninevite boy I heard of once. He was one of King Sennacherib&rsquo;s sons,
and a traveller brought him a Psammead. He used to keep it in a box of sand
on the palace terrace. It was a dreadful degradation for one of us, of
course; still the boy <EMPH>was</EMPH> the Assyrian King&rsquo;s son. And
one day he wished for wings and got them. But he forgot that they would
turn into stone at sunset, and when they did he fell slap on to one of the
winged lions at the top of his father&rsquo;s great staircase;
<PB ID="p115" N="115">
and what with <EMPH>his</EMPH> stone wings and the lions&rsquo; stone
wings&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s not a pretty story! But I believe the boy
enjoyed himself very much till then.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t our wishes
turn into stone now? Why do they just vanish?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<FOREIGN LANG="fre">Autres temps, autres
m&oelig;urs</FOREIGN>,&rdquo; said the creature.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It that the Ninevite language?&rdquo; asked Anthea, who had
learned no foreign language at school except French.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What I mean is,&rdquo; the Psammead went on, &ldquo;that in the
old days people wished for good solid everyday gifts&mdash;Mammoths and
Pterodactyls and things&mdash;and those could be turned into stone as easy
as not, But people wish such high&hyphen;flying fanciful things nowadays.
How are you going to turn being beautiful as the day, or being wanted by
everybody, into stone? You see it can&rsquo;t be done. And it would never
do to have two rules, so they simply vanish. If being beautiful as the day
<EMPH>could</EMPH> be turned into stone it would last an awfully long time,
you know&mdash;much longer
<PB ID="p116" N="116">
than you would. Just look at the Greek statues. It&rsquo;s just as well as
it is. Good&hyphen;bye. I <EMPH>am</EMPH> so sleepy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It jumped off her lap&mdash;dug frantically, and vanished.</P>
<P>Anthea was late for breakfast. It was Robert who quietly poured a
spoonful of treacle down the Lamb&rsquo;s frock, so that he had to be taken
away and washed thoroughly directly after breakfast. And it was of course a
very naughty thing to do; yet it served two purposes&mdash;it delighted the
Lamb, who loved above all things to be completely sticky, and it engaged
Martha&rsquo;s attention so that the others could slip away to the
sand&hyphen;pit without the Lamb.</P>
<P>They did it, and in the lane Anthea, breathless from the skurry of that
slipping, panted out&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I want to propose we take turns to wish. Only, nobody&rsquo;s to
have a wish if the others don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a nice wish. Do you
agree?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to have first wish?&rdquo; asked Robert
cautiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Me, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Anthea
<PB ID="p117" N="117">
apologetically. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve thought about it&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
<EMPH>wings</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a silence. The others rather wanted to find fault, but it was
hard, because the word &ldquo;wings&rdquo; raised a flutter of joyous
excitement in every breast.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not so dusty,&rdquo; said Cyril generously; and Robert added,
&ldquo;Really, Panther, you&rsquo;re not quite such a fool as you
look.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane said, &ldquo;I think it would be perfectly lovely. It&rsquo;s like
a bright dream of delirium.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They found the Sand&hyphen;fairy easily. Anthea said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we all had beautiful wings to fly with.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Sand&hyphen;fairy blew himself out, and next moment each child felt
a funny feeling, half heaviness and half lightness, on its shoulders. The
Psammead put its head on one side and turned its snail&rsquo;s eyes from
one to the other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not so dusty,&rdquo; it said dreamily. &ldquo;But really, Robert,
you&rsquo;re not quite such an angel as you look.&rdquo; Robert almost
blushed.</P>
<P>The wings were very big, and more beautiful than you can possibly
imagine&mdash;for they were
<PB ID="p118" N="118">
soft and smooth, and every feather lay neatly in its place. And the
feathers were of the most lovely mixed changing colours, like the rainbow,
or iridescent glass, or the beautiful scum that sometimes floats on water
that is not at all nice to drink.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;but can we fly?&rdquo; Jane said, standing anxiously
first on one foot and then on the other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re treading on my
wing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; asked Anthea with interest; but no one
answered, for Robert had spread his wings and jumped up, and now he was
slowly rising in the air. He looked very awkward in his knickerbocker
suit&mdash;his boots in particular hung helplessly, and seemed much larger
than when he was standing in them. But the others cared but little how he
looked,&mdash;or how they looked, for that matter. For now they all spread
out their wings and rose in the air. Of course you all know what flying
feels like, because everyone has dreamed about flying, and it seems so
beautifully easy&mdash;only, you can never remember how you did
<PB ID="p119" N="119">
it; and as a rule you have to do it without wings, in your dreams, which is
more clever and uncommon, but not so easy to remember the rule for. Now the
four children rose flapping from the ground, and you can&rsquo;t think how
good the air felt running against their faces. Their wings were
tremendously wide when they were spread out, and they had to fly quite a
long way apart so as not to get in each other&rsquo;s way. But little
things like this are easily learned.</P>
<P>All the words in the English Dictionary, and in the Greek Lexicon as
well, are, I find, of no use at all to tell you exactly what it feels like
to be flying, so I will not try. But I will say that to look
<EMPH>down</EMPH> on the fields and woods, instead of <EMPH>along</EMPH> at
them, is something like looking at a beautiful live map, where, instead of
silly colours on paper, you have real moving sunny woods and green fields
laid out one after the other. As Cyril said, and I can&rsquo;t think where
he got hold of such a strange expression, &ldquo;It does you a fair
treat!&rdquo; It was almost wonderful and more like real magic than any
wish the children had had yet.
<PB ID="p120" N="120">
They flapped and flew and sailed on their great rainbow wings, between
green earth and blue sky; and they flew right over Rochester and then
swerved round towards Maidstone, and presently they all began to feel
extremely hungry. Curiously enough this happened when they were flying
rather low, and just as they were crossing an orchard where some early
plums shone red and ripe.</P>
<P>They paused on their wings. I cannot explain to you how this is done,
but it is something like treading water when you are swimming, and hawks do
it extremely well.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I daresay,&rdquo; said Cyril, though no one had spoken.
&ldquo;But stealing is stealing even if you&rsquo;ve got wings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; said Jane briskly. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ve got wings you&rsquo;re a bird, and no one minds birds breaking
the commandments. At least, they may <EMPH>mind</EMPH>, but the birds
always do it, and no one scolds them or sends them to prison.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was not so easy to perch on a plum&hyphen;tree as you might think,
because the rainbow wings were so <EMPH>very</EMPH> large; but somehow
<PB ID="pf120">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five120"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p121" N="121">
they all managed to do it, and the plums were certainly very sweet and
juicy.</P>
<P>Fortunately, it was not till they had all had quite as many plums as
were good for them that they saw a stout man, who looked exactly as though
he owned the plum&hyphen;trees, come hurrying through the orchard gate with
a thick stick, and with one accord they disentangled their wings from the
plum&hyphen;laden branches and began to fly.</P>
<P>The man stopped short, with his mouth open. For he had seen the boughs
of his trees moving and twitching, and he had said to himself, &ldquo;Them
young varmint&mdash;at it again!&rdquo; And he had come out at once, for
the lads of the village had taught him in past seasons that plums want
looking after. But when he saw the rainbow wings flutter up out of the
plum&hyphen;tree he felt that he must have gone quite mad, and he did not
like the feeling at all. And when Anthea looked down and saw his mouth go
slowly open, and stay so, and his face become green and mauve in patches,
she called out&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; and felt hastily in
<PB ID="p122" N="122">
her pocket for a threepenny&hyphen;bit with a hole in it, which she had
meant to hang on a ribbon round her neck, for luck. She hovered round the
unfortunate plum&hyphen;owner, and said&colon; &ldquo;We have had some of
your plums; we thought it wasn&rsquo;t stealing, but now I am not so sure.
So here&rsquo;s some money to pay for them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She swooped down towards the terror&hyphen;stricken grower of plums, and
slipped the coin into the pocket of his jacket, and in a few flaps she had
rejoined the others.</P>
<P>The farmer sat down on the grass, suddenly and heavily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;m blessed!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This here is
what they call delusions, I suppose. But this here
threeepenny&rdquo;&mdash;he had pulled it out and bitten
it,&mdash;&ldquo;<EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> real enough. Well, from this day
forth I&rsquo;ll be a better man. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing to sober a
chap for life, this is. I&rsquo;m glad it was only wings, though. I&rsquo;d
rather see birds as aren&rsquo;t there, and couldn&rsquo;t be, even if they
pretend to talk, than some things as I could name.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He got up slowly and heavily, and went indoors, and he was so nice to
his wife that
<PB ID="pf122">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five122"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p123" N="123">
day that she felt quite happy, and said to herself, &ldquo;Law, whatever
have a&hyphen;come to the man!&rdquo; and smartened herself up and put a
blue ribbon bow at the place where her collar fastened on, and looked so
pretty that he was kinder than ever. So perhaps the winged children really
did do one good thing that day. If so, it was the only one; for really
there is nothing like wings for getting you into trouble. But, on the other
hand, if you are in trouble, there is nothing like wings for getting you
out of it.</P>
<P>This was the case in the matter of the fierce dog who sprang out at them
when they had folded up their wings as small as possible and were going up
to a farm door to ask for a crust of bread and cheese, for in spite of the
plums they were soon just as hungry as ever again.</P>
<P>Now there is no doubt whatever that, if the four had been ordinary
wingless children, that black and fierce dog would have had a good bite out
of the brown&hyphen;stockinged leg of Robert, who was the nearest. But at
its first growl there was a flutter of wings, and the dog was
<PB ID="p124" N="124">
left to strain at his chain and stand on his hind&hyphen;legs as if he were
trying to fly too.</P>
<P>They tried several other farms, but at those where there were no dogs
the people were far too frightened to do anything but scream; and at last,
when it was nearly four o&rsquo;clock and their wings were getting
miserably stiff and tired, they alighted on a church&hyphen;tower and held
a council of war.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t possibly fly all the way home without dinner
<EMPH>or</EMPH> tea,&rdquo; said Robert with desperate decision.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And nobody will give us any dinner, or even lunch, let alone
tea,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Perhaps the clergyman here might,&rdquo; suggested Anthea.
&ldquo;He must know all about angels&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Anybody could see we&rsquo;re not that,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;Look at Robert&rsquo;s boot and Squirrel&rsquo;s plaid
necktie.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyril firmly, &ldquo;if the country
you&rsquo;re in won&rsquo;t <EMPH>sell</EMPH> provisions, you
<EMPH>take</EMPH> them. In wars I mean. I&rsquo;m quite certain you do. And
even in other stories no good brother
<PB ID="p125" N="125">
would allow his little sister to starve in the midst of plenty.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Plenty?&rdquo; repeated Robert hungrily; and the others looked
vaguely round the bare leads of the church tower, and murmured, &ldquo;In
the midst of?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cyril impressively. &ldquo;There is a larder
window at the side of the clergyman&rsquo;s house, and I saw things to eat
inside&mdash;custard pudding and cold chicken and tongue&mdash;and
pies&mdash;and jam. It&rsquo;s rather a high window&mdash;but with
wings&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How clever of you!&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Cyril modestly; &ldquo;any born
general&mdash;Napoleon or the Duke of Marlborough&mdash;would have seen it
just the same as I did.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It seems very wrong,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;What was it Sir Philip Sidney
said when the soldier wouldn&rsquo;t stand him a drink?&mdash;&lsquo;My
necessity is greater than his.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll club our money, though, and leave it to pay for the
things, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Anthea was persuasive, and very nearly in
tears, because it is most trying to feel enormously
<PB ID="p126" N="126">
hungry and unspeakably sinful at one and the same time.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Some of it,&rdquo; was the cautious reply.</P>
<P>Everyone now turned out its pockets on the lead roof of the tower, where
visitors for the last hundred and fifty years had cut their own and their
sweethearts&rsquo; initials with pen&hyphen;knives in the soft lead. There
was five&hyphen;and&hyphen;sevenpence halfpenny altogether, and even the
upright Anthea admitted that that was too much to pay for four
people&rsquo;s dinners. Robert said he thought eighteenpence.</P>
<P>And a half&hyphen;a&hyphen;crown was finally agreed to be
&ldquo;handsome.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So Anthea wrote on the back of her last term&rsquo;s report, which
happened to be in her pocket, and from which she first tore her own name
and that of the school, the following letter&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;DEAR REVEREND CLERGYMAN, We are very hungry indeed because of
having to fly all day, and we think it is not stealing when you are
starving to death. We are afraid to ask you for fear you should say
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; because
<PB ID="pf126">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five126"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p127" N="127">
of course you know about angels, but you would not think we were angels. We
will only take the necessities of life, and no pudding or pie, to show you
it is not greediness but true starvation that makes us make your larder
stand and deliver. But we are not highwaymen by trade.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Cut it short,&rdquo; said the others with one accord. And Anthea
hastily added&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Our intentions are quite honourable if you only knew. And here is
half&hyphen;a&hyphen;crown to show we are sinseer and grateful.</P>
<P>&rdquo;Thank you for your kind hospitality.</P>
<P>&ldquo;FROM US FOUR.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The half&hyphen;crown was wrapped in this letter, and all the children
felt that when the clergyman had read it he would understand everything, as
well as anyone could who had not seen the wings.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;of course there&rsquo;s some risk;
we&rsquo;d better fly straight down the other side of the tower and then
flutter low across the churchyard and in through the shrubbery.
<PB ID="p128" N="128">
There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone about. But you never know. The window
looks out into the shrubbery. It is embowered in foliage, like a window in
a story. I&rsquo;ll go in and get the things. Robert and Anthea can take
them as I hand them out through the window; and Jane can keep
watch&mdash;her eyes are sharp,&mdash; and whistle if she sees anyone
about. Shut up, Robert! she can whistle quite well enough for that, anyway.
It ought not to be a very good whistle&mdash;it&rsquo;ll sound more natural
and birdlike. Now then&mdash;off we go!&rdquo;</P>
<P>I cannot pretend that stealing is right. I can only say that on this
occasion it did not look like stealing to the hungry four, but appeared in
the light of a fair and reasonable business transaction. They had never
happened to learn that a tongue&mdash;hardly cut into&mdash;a chicken and a
half, a loaf of bread, and a syphon of soda&hyphen;water cannot be bought
in shops for half&hyphen;a&hyphen;crown. These were the necessaries of
life, which Cyril handed out of the larder window when, quite unobserved
and without hindrance or adventure, he had led the others to that happy
spot.
<PB ID="pf128">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five128"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p129" N="129">
He felt that to refrain from jam, apple turnovers, cake, and mixed candied
peel, was a really heroic act&mdash;and I agree with him. He was also proud
of not taking the custard pudding,&mdash;and there I think he was
wrong,&mdash;because if he had taken it there would have been a difficulty
about returning the dish; no one, however starving, has a right to steal
china pie&hyphen;dishes with little pink flowers on them. The
soda&hyphen;water syphon was different. They could not do without something
to drink, and as the maker&rsquo;s name was on it they felt sure it would
be returned to him wherever they might leave it. If they had time they
would take it back themselves. The man appeared to live in Rochester, which
would not be much out of their way home.</P>
<P>Everything was carried up to the top of the tower, and laid down on a
sheet of kitchen paper which Cyril had found on the top shelf of the
larder. As he unfolded it, Anthea said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
<EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> a necessity of life.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We must put the things down
somewhere to cut them up; and
<PB ID="p130" N="130">
I heard father say the other day people get diseases from germans in
rain&hyphen;water. Now there must be lots of rain&hyphen;water
here,&mdash;and when it dries up the germans are left, and they&rsquo;d get
into the things, and we should all die of scarlet fever.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What are germans?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Little waggly things you see with microscopes,&rdquo; said Cyril,
with a scientific air. &ldquo;They give you every illness you can think of.
I&rsquo;m sure the paper was a necessary, just as much as the bread and
meat and water. Now then! Oh, my eyes, I am hungry!&rdquo;</P>
<P>I do not wish to describe the picnic party on the top of the tower. You
can imagine well enough what it is like to carve a chicken and a tongue
with a knife that has only one blade&mdash; and that snapped off short
about half&hyphen;way down. But it was done. Eating with your fingers is
greasy and difficult&mdash;and paper dishes soon get to look very spotty
and horrid. But one thing you <EMPH>can&rsquo;t</EMPH> imagine, and that is
how soda&hyphen;water behaves when you try to drink it straight out of a
syphon&mdash;especially a quite full one. But if imagination will not help
you,
<PB ID="p131" N="131">
experience will, and you can easily try it for yourself if you can get a
grown&hyphen;up to give you the syphon. If you want to have a really
thorough experience, put the tube in your mouth and press the handle very
suddenly and very hard. You had better do it when you are alone&mdash;and
out of doors is best for this experiment.</P>
<P>However you eat them, tongue and chicken and new bread are very good
things, and no one minds being sprinkled a little with soda&hyphen;water on
a really fine hot day. So that everyone enjoyed the dinner very much
indeed, and everyone ate as much as it possibly could&colon; first, because
it was extremely hungry; and secondly, because as I said, tongue and
chicken and new bread are very nice.</P>
<P>Now, I daresay you will have noticed that if you have to wait for your
dinner till long after the proper time, and then eat a great deal more
dinner than usual, and sit in the hot sun on the top of a
church&hyphen;tower&mdash;or even anywhere else&mdash;you become soon and
strangely sleepy. Now Anthea and Jane and Cyril and Robert were very like
you
<PB ID="p132" N="132">
in many ways, and when they had eaten all they could, and drunk all there
was, they became sleepy, strangely and soon&mdash;especially Anthea,
because she had got up so early.</P>
<P>One by one they left off talking and leaned back, and before it was a
quarter of an hour after dinner they had all curled round and tucked
themselves up under their large soft warm wings and were fast asleep. And
the sun was sinking slowly in the west. (I must say it was in the west,
because it is usual in books to say so, for fear careless people should
think it was setting in the east. In point of fact, it was not exactly in
the west either&mdash;but that&rsquo;s near enough.) The sun, I repeat, was
sinking slowly in the west, and the children slept warmly and happily
on&mdash;for wings are cosier than eiderdown quilts to sleep under. The
shadow of the church&hyphen;tower fell across the churchyard, and across
the Vicarage, and across the field beyond; and presently there were no more
shadows, and the sun had set, and the wings were gone. And still the
children slept. But not for long. Twilight is very beautiful, but it is
<PB ID="pf132">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five132"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p133" N="133">
chilly; and you know, however sleepy you are, you wake up soon enough if
your brother or sister happens to be up first and pulls your blankets off
you. The four wingless children shivered and woke. And there they
were&mdash;on the top of a church&hyphen;tower in the dusky twilight, with
blue stars coming out by ones and twos and tens and twenties over their
heads,&mdash;miles away from home, with three and three&hyphen;halfpence in
their pockets, and a doubtful act about the necessities of life to be
accounted for if anyone found them with the soda&hyphen;water syphon.</P>
<P>They looked at each other. Cyril spoke first, picking up the
syphon&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get along down and get rid of this beastly
thing. It&rsquo;s dark enough to leave it on the clergyman&rsquo;s
doorstep, I should think. Come on.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a little turret at the corner of the tower, and the little
turret had a door in it. They had noticed this when they were eating, but
had not explored it, as you would have done in their place. Because, of
course, when you have wings, and can explore the
<PB ID="p134" N="134">
whole sky, doors seem hardly worth exploring.</P>
<P>Now they turned towards it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;this is the way
down.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was. But the door was locked on the inside!</P>
<P>And the world was growing darker and darker. And they were miles from
home. And there was the soda&hyphen;water syphon.</P>
<P>I shall not tell you whether anyone cried, nor, if so, how many cried,
nor who cried. You will be better employed in making up your minds what you
would have done if you had been in their place.</P>
</DIV0>
<PB ID="p135" N="135">
<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NO WINGS</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHETHER</HI> anyone cried or not, there was certainly an interval
during which none of the party was quite itself. When they grew calmer,
Anthea put her handkerchief in her pocket and her arm round Jane, and
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be for more than one night. We can signal with our
handkerchiefs in the morning. They&rsquo;ll be dry then. And someone will
come up and let us out&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And find the syphon,&rdquo; said Cyril gloomily; &ldquo;and we
shall be sent to prison for stealing&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You said it wasn&rsquo;t stealing. You said you were sure it
wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure <EMPH>now</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril
shortly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s throw the beastly thing slap away among the
trees,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;then no one can do anything to
us.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p136" N="136">
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo;&mdash;Cyril&rsquo;s laugh was not a lighthearted
one&mdash;&ldquo;and hit some chap on the head, and be murderers as well
as&mdash;as the other thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t stay up here all night,&rdquo; said Jane;
&ldquo;and I want my tea.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You <EMPH>can&rsquo;t</EMPH> want your tea,&rdquo; said Robert;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve only just had your dinner.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But I <EMPH>do</EMPH> want it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;especially
when you begin talking about stopping up here all night. Oh,
Panther&mdash;I want to go home! I want to go home!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; Anthea said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear.
It&rsquo;ll be all right, somehow. Don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let her cry,&rdquo; said Robert desperately; &ldquo;if she howls
loud enough, someone may hear and come and let us out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And see the soda&hyphen;water thing,&rdquo; said Anthea swiftly.
&ldquo;Robert, don&rsquo;t be a brute. Oh, Jane, do try to be a man!
It&rsquo;s just the same for all of us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane did try to &ldquo;be a man&rdquo;&mdash;and reduced her howls to
sniffs.</P>
<P>There was a pause. Then Cyril said slowly, &ldquo;Look here. We must
risk that syphon. I&rsquo;ll
<PB ID="p137" N="137">
button it up inside my jacket&mdash;perhaps no one will notice it. You
others keep well in front of me. There are lights in the clergyman&rsquo;s
house. They&rsquo;ve not gone to bed yet. We must just yell as loud as ever
we can. Now all scream when I say three. Robert, you do the yell like the
railway engine, and I&rsquo;ll do the coo&hyphen;ee like father&rsquo;s.
The girls can do as they please. One, two, three!&rdquo;</P>
<P>A fourfold yell rent the silent peace of the evening, and a maid at one
of the Vicarage windows paused with her hand on the blind&hyphen;cord.</P>
<P>&ldquo;One, two, three!&rdquo; Another yell, piercing and complex,
startled the owls and starlings to a flutter of feathers in the belfry
below. The maid fled from the Vicarage window and ran down the Vicarage
stairs and into the Vicarage kitchen, and fainted as soon as she had
explained to the man&hyphen;servant and the cook and the cook&rsquo;s
cousin that she had seen a ghost. It was quite untrue, of course, but I
suppose the girl&rsquo;s nerves were a little upset by the yelling.</P>
<P>&ldquo;One, two, three!&rdquo; The Vicar was on his
<PB ID="p138" N="138">
doorstep by this time, and there was no mistaking the yell that greeted
him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Goodness me,&rdquo; he said to his wife, &ldquo;my dear,
someone&rsquo;s being murdered in the church! Give me my hat and a thick
stick, and tell Andrew to come after me. I expect it&rsquo;s the lunatic
who stole the tongue.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children had seen the flash of light when the Vicar opened his front
door. They had seen his dark form on the doorstep, and they had paused for
breath, and also to see what he would do.</P>
<P>When he turned back for his hat, Cyril said hastily&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He thinks he only fancied he heard something. You don&rsquo;t
half yell; Now! One, two, three!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was certainly a whole yell this time, and the Vicar&rsquo;s wife
flung her arms round her husband and screamed a feeble echo of it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not alone.
Jessie!&rdquo;&mdash;the maid unfainted and came out of the
kitchen&mdash;&ldquo;send Andrew at once. There&rsquo;s a dangerous lunatic
in the church, and he must go immediately and catch it.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p139" N="139">
<P>&ldquo;I expect he <EMPH>will</EMPH> catch it too,&rdquo; said Jessie to
herself as she went through the kitchen door. &ldquo;Here, Andrew,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s someone screaming like mad in the church,
and the missus says you&rsquo;re to go along and catch it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not alone, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Andrew in low firm tones.
To his master he merely said, &ldquo;<SIC CORR="Yes">Yis</SIC>,
sir.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You heard those screams?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I did think I noticed a sort of something,&rdquo; said
Andrew.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, come on, then,&rdquo; said the Vicar. &ldquo;My dear, I
<EMPH>must</EMPH> go!&rdquo; He pushed her gently into the
sitting&hyphen;room, banged the door, and rushed out, dragging Andrew by
the arm.</P>
<P>A volley of yells greeted them. As it died into silence Andrew shouted,
&ldquo;Hullo, you there ! Did you call?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; shouted four far&hyphen;away voices.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They seem to be in the air,&rdquo; said the Vicar. &ldquo;Very
remarkable.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; shouted Andrew&colon; and Cyril replied in
his deepest voice, very slowly and loud&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p140" N="140">
<P>&ldquo;CHURCH! TOWER! TOP!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come down, then !&rdquo; said Andrew; and the same voice
replied&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Can&rsquo;t! Door locked!</EMPH>&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; said the Vicar. &ldquo;Andrew, fetch the
stable lantern. Perhaps it would be as well to fetch another man from the
village.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;With the rest of the gang about, very likely. No sir; if this
&rsquo;ere ain&rsquo;t a trap&mdash;well, may I never! There&rsquo;s
cook&rsquo;s cousin at the back door now. He&rsquo;s a keeper, sir, and
used to dealing with vicious characters. And he&rsquo;s got his gun,
sir.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo there!&rdquo; shouted Cyril from the church&hyphen;tower;
&ldquo;come up and let us out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a&hyphen;coming,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a&hyphen;going to get a policeman and a gun.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Andrew, Andrew,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not
the truth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s near enough, sir, for the likes of them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So Andrew fetched the lantern and the cook&rsquo;s cousin; and the
Vicar&rsquo;s wife begged them all to be very careful.</P>
<P>They went across the churchyard&mdash;it was
<PB ID="p141" N="141">
quite dark now &mdash; and as they went they talked. The Vicar was certain
a lunatic was on the church&hyphen;tower&mdash;the one who had written the
mad letter, and taken the cold tongue and things. Andrew thought it was a
&ldquo;trap&rdquo;; the cook&rsquo;s cousin alone was calm. &ldquo;Great
cry, little wool,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;dangerous chaps is quieter.&rdquo;
He was not at all afraid. But then he had a gun. That was why he was asked
to lead the way up the worn steep dark steps of the church&hyphen;tower. He
did lead the way, with the lantern in one hand and the gun in the other.
Andrew went next. He pretended afterwards that this was because he was
braver than his master, but really it was because he thought of traps, and
he did not like the idea of being behind the others for fear someone should
come softly up behind him and catch hold of his legs in the dark. They went
on and on, and round and round the little corkscrew staircase&mdash;then
through the bell&hyphen;ringers&rsquo; loft, where the bell&hyphen;ropes
hung with soft furry ends like giant caterpillars&mdash;then up another
stair into the belfry, where the big quiet bells are&mdash;and then on, up
a ladder with broad steps
<PB ID="p142" N="142">
&mdash;and then up a little stone stair. And at the top of that there was a
little door. And the door was bolted on the stair side.</P>
<P>The cook&rsquo;s cousin, who was a gamekeeper, kicked at the door, and
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo, you there!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children were holding on to each other on the other side of the
door, and trembling with anxiousness&mdash;and very hoarse with their
howls. They could hardly speak, but Cyril managed to reply
huskily&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo, you there!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How did you get up there?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was no use saying &ldquo;We flew up,&rdquo; so Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We got up&mdash;and then we found the door was locked and we
couldn&rsquo;t get down. Let us out&mdash;do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How many of you are there?&rdquo; asked the keeper.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Only four,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are we what?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my gun handy&mdash;so you&rsquo;d best not try any
tricks,&rdquo; said the keeper. &ldquo;If we open
<PB ID="pf143">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five143"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p143" N="143">
the door, will you promise to come quietly down, and no
nonsense?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh YES!&rdquo; said all the children together.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;surely that was a female
voice?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shall I open the door, sir?&rdquo; said the keeper. Andrew went
down a few steps, &ldquo;to leave room for the others&rdquo; he said
afterwards.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;open the door.
Remember,&rdquo; he said through the keyhole, &ldquo;we have come to
release you. You will keep your promise to refrain from
violence?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How this bolt do stick,&rdquo; said the keeper; &ldquo;anyone
&rsquo;ud think it hadn&rsquo;t been drawed for half a year.&rdquo; As a
matter of fact it hadn&rsquo;t.</P>
<P>When all the bolts were drawn, the keeper spoke deep&hyphen;chested
words through the keyhole.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t open,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;till you&rsquo;ve gone
over to the other side of the tower. And if one of you comes at me I fire.
Now!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all over on the other side,&rdquo; said the
voices.</P>
<P>The keeper felt pleased with himself, and owned himself a bold man when
he threw
<PB ID="p144" N="144">
open that door, and, stepping out into the leads, flashed the full light of
the stable lantern on to the group of desperadoes standing against the
parapet on the other side of the tower.</P>
<P>He lowered his gun, and he nearly dropped the lantern.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So help me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if they ain&rsquo;t a pack of
kiddies!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Vicar now advanced.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo; he asked severely. &ldquo;Tell me
at once.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, take us down,&rdquo; said Jane, catching at his coat,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll tell you anything you like. You won&rsquo;t believe
us, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Oh, take us down!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others crowded round him, with the same entreaty. All but Cyril. He
had enough to do with the soda&hyphen;water syphon, which would keep
slipping down under his jacket. It needed both hands to keep it steady in
its place.</P>
<P>But he said, standing as far out of the lantern light as
possible&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Please do take us down.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p145" N="145">
<P>So they were taken down. It is no joke to go down a strange
church&hyphen;tower in the dark, but the keeper helped them&mdash;only
Cyril had to be independent because of the soda&hyphen;water syphon. It
would keep trying to get away. Half&hyphen;way down the ladder it all but
escaped. Cyril just caught it by its spout, and as nearly as possible lost
his footing. He was trembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom
of the winding stair and stepped out on to the flags of the
church&hyphen;porch.</P>
<P>Then suddenly the keeper caught Cyril and Robert each by an arm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You bring along the gells, sir,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you and
Andrew can manage them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;we aren&rsquo;t running away.
We haven&rsquo;t hurt your old church. Leave go!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You just come along,&rdquo; said the keeper; and Cyril dared not
oppose him with violence, because just then the syphon began to slip
again.</P>
<P>So they were all marched into the Vicarage study, and the Vicar&rsquo;s
wife came rushing in.</P>
<PB ID="p146" N="146">
<P>&ldquo;Oh, William, <EMPH>are</EMPH> you safe?&rdquo; she cried.</P>
<P>Robert hastened to allay her anxiety.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s quite safe. We
haven&rsquo;t hurt him at all. And please, we&rsquo;re very late, and
they&rsquo;ll be anxious at home. Could you send us home in your
carriage?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or perhaps there&rsquo;s a hotel near where we could get a
carriage from,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Martha will be very anxious as it
is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Vicar had sunk into a chair, overcome by emotion and amazement.</P>
<P>Cyril had also sat down, and was leaning forward with his elbows on his
knees because of that soda&hyphen;water syphon.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But how did you come to be locked up in the
church&hyphen;tower?&rdquo; asked the Vicar.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We went up,&rdquo; said Robert slowly, &ldquo;and we were tired,
and we all went to sleep, and when we woke up we found the door was locked,
so we yelled.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should think you did!&rdquo; said the Vicar&rsquo;s wife.
&ldquo;Frightening everybody out of their wits like this! You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We <EMPH>are</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Jane gently.</P>
<PB ID="p147" N="147">
<P>&ldquo;But who locked the door?&rdquo; asked the Vicar.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all,&rdquo; said Robert, with perfect
truth. &ldquo;Do please send us home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d
better. Andrew, put the horse to, and you can take them home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not alone, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Andrew to himself.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; the Vicar went on, &ldquo;let this be a lesson to
you&rdquo;&mdash; He went on talking, and the children listened miserably.
But the keeper was not listening. He was looking at the unfortunate Cyril.
He knew all about poachers of course, so he knew how people look when
they&rsquo;re hiding something. The Vicar had just got to the part about
trying to grow up to be a blessing to your parents, and not a trouble and a
disgrace, when the keeper suddenly said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Arst him what he&rsquo;s got there under his jacket;&rdquo; and
Cyril knew that concealment was at an end. So he stood up, and squared his
shoulders and tried to look noble, like the boys in books that no one can
look in the face of and doubt that they come of brave and noble
<PB ID="p148" N="148">
families, and will be faithful to the death, and he pulled out the
soda&hyphen;water syphon and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, there you are, then.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a silence, Cyril went on&mdash;there was nothing else for
it&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, we took this out of your larder, and some chicken and tongue
and bread. We were very hungry, and we didn&rsquo;t take the custard or
jam. We only took bread and meat and water,&mdash;and we couldn&rsquo;t
help its being the soda kind,&mdash;just the necessaries of life; and we
left half&hyphen;a&hyphen;crown to pay for it, and we left a letter. And
we&rsquo;re very sorry. And my father will pay a fine or anything you like,
but don&rsquo;t send us to prison. Mother would be so vexed. You know what
you said about not being a disgrace. Well, don&rsquo;t you go and do it to
us&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! We&rsquo;re as sorry as we can be.
There!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;However did you get up to the larder window?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Vicar.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; said Cyril firmly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is this the whole truth you&rsquo;ve been telling me?&rdquo;
asked the clergyman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jane suddenly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all true,
<PB ID="p149" N="149">
but it&rsquo;s not the whole truth. We can&rsquo;t tell you that.
It&rsquo;s no good asking. Oh, do forgive us and take us home!&rdquo; She
ran to the Vicar&rsquo;s wife and threw her arms round her. The
Vicar&rsquo;s wife put her arms round Jane, and the keeper whispered behind
his hand to the Vicar&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right, sir&mdash;I expect it&rsquo;s a pal
they&rsquo;re standing by. Someone put &rsquo;em up to it, and they
won&rsquo;t peach. Game little kids.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said the Vicar kindly, &ldquo;are you screening
someone else? Had anyone else anything to do with this?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, thinking of the Psammead, &ldquo;but it
wasn&rsquo;t their fault.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Very well, my dears,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;then
let&rsquo;s say no more about it. Only just tell us why you wrote such an
odd letter.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;You see, Anthea
wrote it in such a hurry, and it really didn&rsquo;t seem like stealing
then. But afterwards, when we found we couldn&rsquo;t get down off the
church&hyphen;tower, it seemed just exactly like it. We are all very
sorry&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p150" N="150">
<P>&ldquo;Say no more about it,&rdquo; said the Vicar&rsquo;s wife;
&ldquo;but another time just think before you take other people&rsquo;s
tongues. Now&mdash;some cake and milk before you go home?&rdquo;</P>
<P>When Andrew came to say that the horse was put to, and was he expected
to be led alone into the trap that he had plainly seen from the first, he
found the children eating cake and drinking milk and laughing at the
Vicar&rsquo;s jokes. Jane was sitting on the Vicar&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s
lap.</P>
<P>So you see they got off better than they deserved.</P>
<P>The gamekeeper, who was the cook&rsquo;s cousin, asked leave to drive
home with them, and Andrew was only too glad to have someone to protect him
from the trap he was so certain of.</P>
<P>When the waggonette reached their own house, between the
chalk&hyphen;quarry and the gravel&hyphen;pit, the children were very
sleepy, but they felt that they and the keeper were friends for life.</P>
<P>Andrew dumped the children down at the iron gate without a word.</P>
<PB ID="p151" N="151">
<P>&ldquo;You get along home,&rdquo; said the Vicarage cook&rsquo;s cousin,
who was a gamekeeper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get me home on Shanks&rsquo;
mare.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So Andrew had to drive off alone, which he did not like at all, and it
was the keeper that was cousin to the Vicarage cook who went with the
children to the door, and, when they had been swept to bed in a whirlwind
of reproaches, remained to explain to Martha and the cook and the housemaid
exactly what had happened. He explained so well that Martha was quite
amicable the next morning.</P>
<P>After that he often used to come over and see Martha, and in the
end&mdash;but that is another story, as dear Mr. Kipling says.</P>
<P>Martha was obliged to stick to what she had said the night before about
keeping the children indoors the next day for a punishment. But she
wasn&rsquo;t at all snarky about it, and agreed to let Robert go out for
half an hour to get something he particularly wanted.</P>
<P>This, of course, was the day&rsquo;s wish.</P>
<P>Robert rushed to the gravel&hyphen;pit, found the Psammead, and
presently wished for&mdash;</P>
<P>But that, too, is another story.</P>
</DIV0>
<PB ID="p153" N="153">
<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A CASTLE AND NO DINNER</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> others were to be kept in as a punishment for the
misfortunes of the day before. Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness,
and not misfortune&mdash;so you must not blame her. She only thought she
was doing her duty. You know grown&hyphen;up people often say they do not
like to punish you, and that they only do it for your own good, and that it
hurts them as much as it hurts you&mdash;and this is really very often the
truth.</P>
<P>Martha certainly hated having to punish the children quite as much as
they hated to be punished. For one thing, she knew what a noise there would
be in the house all day. And she had other reasons.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; she said to the cook, &ldquo;it seems almost a
shame keeping of them indoors this
<PB ID="p154" N="154">
lovely day; but they are that audacious, they&rsquo;ll be walking in with
their heads knocked off some of these days, if I don&rsquo;t put my foot
down. You make them a cake for tea to&hyphen;morrow, dear. And we&rsquo;ll
have Baby along of us as we&rsquo;ve got a bit <SIC
CORR="forward">forrard</SIC> with our work. Then they can have a good romp
with him, out of the way. Now, Eliza, come, get on with them beds.
Here&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock nearly, and no rabbits caught!&rdquo;</P>
<P>People say that in Kent when they mean &ldquo;and no work
done.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So all the others were kept in, but Robert, as I have said, was allowed
to go out for half an hour to get something they all wanted. And that, of
course, was the day&rsquo;s wish.</P>
<P>He had no difficulty in finding the Sand&hyphen;fairy, for the day was
already so hot that it had actually, for the first time, come out of its
own accord, it was sitting in a sort of pool of soft sand, stretching
itself, and trimming its whiskers, and turning its snail&rsquo;s eyes round
and round.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; it said when its left eye saw Robert;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking out for you? Where are
<PB ID="p155" N="155">
the rest of you? Not smashed themselves up with those wings, I
hope?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;but the wings got us into a row,
just like all the wishes always do. So the others are kept indoors, and I
was only let out for half an hour&mdash;to get the wish. So please let me
wish as quickly as I can.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wish away,&rdquo; said the Psammead, twisting itself round in the
sand. But Robert couldn&rsquo;t wish away. He forgot all the things he had
been thinking about, and nothing would come into his head but little things
for himself, like toffee, a foreign stamp album, or a clasp&hyphen;knife
with three blades and a corkscrew. He sat down to think better, but it was
no use. He could only think of things the others would not have cared
for&mdash;such as a football, or a pair of leg&hyphen;guards, or to be able
to lick Simpkins minor thoroughly when he went back to school.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Psammead at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
hurry up with that wish of yours. Time flies.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know it does,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH>
can&rsquo;t think what to wish for. I wish you could
<PB ID="p156" N="156">
give one of the others their wish without their having to come here to ask
for it. Oh, <EMPH>don&rsquo;t!</EMPH>&rdquo;</P>
<P>But it was too late. The Psammead had blown itself out to about three
times its proper size, and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble, and with
a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of its sand&hyphen;pool, quite
faint with the effort.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; it said in a weak voice; &ldquo;it was tremendously
hard&mdash;but I did it. Run along home, or they&rsquo;re sure to wish for
something silly before you get there.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They were&mdash;quite sure; Robert felt this, and as he ran home his
mind was deeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had
wished in his absence. They might wish for rabbits, or white mice or
chocolate, or a fine day to&hyphen;morrow, or even&mdash;and that was most
likely&mdash;someone might have said, &ldquo;I do wish to goodness Robert
would hurry up.&rdquo; Well, he <EMPH>was</EMPH> hurrying up, and so they
would have their wish, and the day would be wasted. Then he tried to think
what they could wish for&mdash;something that would be amusing indoors.
That had
<PB ID="pf157">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five157">
<PB ID="p157" N="157">
</FIGURE>been his own difficulty from the beginning. So few things are
amusing
indoors when the sun is shining outside and you mayn&rsquo;t go out,
however much you want to.</P>
<P>Robert was running as fast as he could, but when he turned the corner
that ought to have brought him within sight of the architect&rsquo;s
nightmare&mdash;the ornamental iron&hyphen;work on the top of the
house&mdash;he opened his eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk; for
you cannot run with your eyes wide open. Then suddenly he stopped short,
for there was no house to be seen. The front&hyphen;garden railings were
gone too, and where the house had stood&mdash;Robert rubbed his eyes and
looked again. Yes, the others <EMPH>had</EMPH> wished,&mdash;there was no
doubt about that,&mdash;and they must have wished that they lived in a
castle; for there the castle stood, black and stately, and very tall and
broad, with battlements and lancet windows, and eight great towers; and,
where the garden and the orchard had been, there were white things dotted
like mushrooms. Robert walked slowly on, and as he got nearer he saw that
these were tents, and men in
<PB ID="p158" N="158">
armour were walking about among the tents&mdash;crowds and crowds of
them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, crikey!&rdquo; said Robert fervently. &ldquo;They
<EMPH>have!</EMPH> They&rsquo;ve wished for a castle, and it&rsquo;s being
besieged! It&rsquo;s just like that Sand&hyphen;fairy! I wish we&rsquo;d
never seen the beastly thing!&rdquo;</P>
<P>At the little window above the great archway, across the moat that now
lay where the garden had been but half an hour ago, someone was waving
something pale dust&hyphen;coloured. Robert thought it was one of
Cyril&rsquo;s handkerchiefs. They had never been white since the day when
he had upset the bottle of &ldquo;Combined Toning and Fixing
Solution&rdquo; into the drawer where they were. Robert waved back, and
immediately felt that he had been unwise. For his signal had been seen by
the besieging force, and two men in steel&hyphen;caps were coming towards
him. They had high brown boots on their long legs, and they came towards
him with such great strides that Robert remembered the shortness of his own
legs and did not run away. He knew it would be useless to
<PB ID="p159" N="159">
himself, and he feared it might be irritating to the foe. So he stood
still&mdash;and the two men seemed quite pleased with him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;By my halidom,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;a brave varlet
this!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert felt pleased at being <EMPH>called</EMPH> brave, and somehow it
made him <EMPH>feel</EMPH> brave. He passed over the &ldquo;varlet&rdquo;.
It was the way people talked in historical romances for the young, he knew,
and it was evidently not meant for rudeness. He only hoped he would be able
to understand what they said to him. He had not always been able quite to
follow the conversations in the historical romances for the young.</P>
<P>&ldquo;His garb is strange,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Some
outlandish treachery, belike.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Say, lad, what brings thee hither?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert knew this meant, &ldquo;Now then, youngster, what are you up to
here, eh?&rdquo;&mdash;so he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you please, I want to go home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go, then!&rdquo; said the man in the longest boots; &ldquo;none
hindereth, and nought lets us to follow. Zooks!&rdquo; he added in a
cautious
<PB ID="p160" N="160">
undertone, &ldquo;I misdoubt me but he beareth tidings to the
besieged.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where dwellest thou, young knave?&rdquo; inquired the man with
the largest steel&hyphen;cap.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; said Robert; and directly he had said it he
knew he ought to have said &ldquo;Yonder!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ha&mdash;sayest so?&rdquo; rejoined the longest boots.
&ldquo;Come hither, boy. This is a matter for our leader.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And to the leader Robert was dragged forthwith&mdash;by the reluctant
ear.</P>
<P>The leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen. He was
exactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical
romances. He had armour, and a helmet, and a horse, and a crest, and
feathers, and a shield, and a lance, and a sword. His armour and his
weapons were all, I am almost sure, of quite different periods. The shield
was thirteenth&hyphen;century, while the sword was of the pattern used in
the Peninsular War. The cuirass was of the time of Charles I, and the
helmet dated from the Second Crusade. The arms on the shield were very
grand&mdash;three
<PB ID="pf160">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five160"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p161" N="161">
red running lions on a blue ground. The tents were of the latest brand and
the whole appearance of camp, army, and leader might have been a shock to
some. But Robert was dumb with admiration, and it all seemed to him
perfectly correct, because he knew no more of heraldry or archaeology than
the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical
romances. The scene was indeed &ldquo;exactly like a picture.&rdquo; He
admired it all so much that he felt braver than ever.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come hither, lad,&rdquo; said the glorious leader, when the men
in Cromwellian steel&hyphen;caps had said a few low eager words. And he
took off his helmet, because he could not see properly with it on. He had a
kind face, and long fair hair. &ldquo;Have no fear; thou shalt take no
scathe,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>Robert was glad of that. He wondered what &ldquo;scathe&rdquo; was, and
if it was nastier than the senna&hyphen;tea which he had to take
sometimes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Unfold thy tale without alarm,&rdquo; said the leader kindly.
&ldquo;Whence comest thou, and what is thine intent?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p162" N="162">
<P>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What seekest thou to accomplish? What is thine errand, that thou
wanderest here alone among these rough men&hyphen;at&hyphen;arms? Poor
child, thy mother&rsquo;s heart aches for thee e&rsquo;en now, I&rsquo;ll
warrant me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;you see, she
doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The leader wiped away a manly tear, exactly as a leader in a historical
romance would have done, and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fear not to speak the truth, my child; thou has nought to fear
from Wulfric de Talbot.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert had a wild feeling that this glorious leader of the besieging
party&mdash;being himself part of a wish&mdash;would be able to understand
better than Martha, or the gipsies, or the policeman in Rochester, or the
clergyman of yesterday, the true tale of the wishes and the Psammead. The
only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough
&ldquo;quothas&rdquo; and &ldquo;beshrew me&rsquo;s&rdquo;, and things like
that, to make his talk sound like the talk of a boy in a historical
romance. However, he
<PB ID="pf162">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five162"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p163" N="163">
began boldly enough, with a sentence straight out of <BIBL>Ralph de Courcy;
or, The Boy Crusader</BIBL>. He said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Grammercy for the courtesy, fair sir knight. The fact is,
it&rsquo;s like this&mdash;and I hope you&rsquo;re not in a hurry, because
the story&rsquo;s rather a breather. Father and mother were away, and when
we were down playing in the sand&hyphen;pits we found a
Psammead.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I cry thee mercy! A Sammyadd?&rdquo; said the knight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, a sort of&mdash;of fairy, or enchanter&mdash;yes,
that&rsquo;s it, an enchanter; and he said we could have a wish every day,
and we wished first to be beautiful.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thy wish was scarce granted,&rdquo; muttered one of the
men&hyphen;at&hyphen;arms, looking at Robert, who went on as if he had not
heard, though he thought the remark very rude indeed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And then we wished for money&mdash;treasure, you know; but we
couldn&rsquo;t spend it. And yesterday we wished for wings, and we got
them, and we had a ripping time to begin with&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thy speech is strange and uncouth,&rdquo; said
<PB ID="p164" N="164">
Sir Wulfric de Talbot. &ldquo;Repeat thy words&mdash;what hadst
thou?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A ripping&mdash;I mean a jolly&mdash;no&mdash;we were contented
with our lot&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I mean; only after that we got into an
awful fix.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is a fix? A fray, mayhap?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No&mdash;not a fray. A&mdash;a&mdash;a tight place.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A dungeon? Alas for thy youthful fettered limbs!&rdquo; said the
knight, with polite sympathy.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a dungeon. We just&mdash;just encountered
undeserved misfortunes,&rdquo; Robert explained, &ldquo;and to&hyphen;day
we are punished by not being allowed to go out. That&rsquo;s where I
live&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the castle. &ldquo;The others are in there,
and they&rsquo;re not allowed to go out. It&rsquo;s all the
Psammead&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean the enchanter&rsquo;s fault. I wish
we&rsquo;d never seen him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He is an enchanter of might?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;of might and main. Rather!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And thou deemest that it is the spells of the enchanter whom thou
hast angered that have lent strength to the besieging party,&rdquo; said
the gallant leader; &ldquo;but know thou that Wulfric de Talbot needs no
enchanter&rsquo;s aid to lead his followers to victory.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p165" N="165">
<P>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Robert, with
hasty courtesy; &ldquo;of course not&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t you know.
But, all the same, it&rsquo;s partly his fault, but we&rsquo;re most to
blame. You couldn&rsquo;t have done anything if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How now, bold boy?&rdquo; asked Sir Wulfric haughtily. &ldquo;Thy
speech is dark, and eke scarce courteous. Unravel me this
riddle!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Robert desperately, &ldquo;of course you
don&rsquo;t know it, but you&rsquo;re not <EMPH>real</EMPH> at all.
You&rsquo;re only here because the others must have been idiots enough to
wish for a castle&mdash; and when the sun sets you&rsquo;ll just vanish
away, and it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The captain and the men&hyphen;at&hyphen;arms exchanged glances, at
first pitying, and then sterner, as the longest&hyphen;booted man said,
&ldquo;Beware, noble my lord; the urchin doth but feign madness to escape
from our clutches. Shall we not bind him?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more mad than you are,&rdquo; said Robert angrily.
&ldquo;perhaps not so much&mdash;only, I was an idiot to think you&rsquo;d
understand anything. Let me go&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t done anything to
you.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p166" N="166">
<P>&ldquo;Whither?&rdquo; asked the knight, who seemed to have believed all
the enchanter story till it came to his own share in it. &ldquo;Whither
wouldst thou wend?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Home, of course,&rdquo; Robert pointed to the castle.</P>
<P>&ldquo;To carry news of succour? Nay!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; said Robert, struck by a sudden idea;
&ldquo;then let me go somewhere else.&rdquo; His mind sought eagerly among
his memories of the historical romance.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sir Wulfric de Talbot,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;should think
foul scorn to&mdash;to keep a chap&mdash;I mean one who has done him no
hurt&mdash;when he wants to cut off quietly&mdash;I mean to depart without
violence.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;This to my face! Beshrew thee for a knave!&rdquo; replied Sir
Wulfric. But the appeal seemed to have gone home. &ldquo;Yet thou sayest
sooth,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully. &ldquo;Go where thou wilt,&rdquo; he
added nobly, &ldquo;thou art free. Wulfric de Talbot warreth not with
babes, and Jakin here shall bear thee company.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Robert wildly. &ldquo;Jakin will
<PB ID="pf167">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five167"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p167" N="167">
enjoy himself, I think. Come on, Jakin. Sir Wulfric, I salute
thee.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He saluted after the modern military manner, and set off running to the
sand&hyphen;pit, Jakin&rsquo;s long boots keeping up easily.</P>
<P>He found the Fairy. He dug it up, he woke it up, he implored it to give
him one more wish.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done two to&hyphen;day already,&rdquo; it grumbled,
&ldquo;and one was as stiff a bit of work as ever I did.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, do, do, do, do, <EMPH>do!</EMPH>&rdquo; said Robert, while
Jakin looked on with an expression of open&hyphen;mouthed horror at the
strange beast that talked, and gazed with its snail&rsquo;s eyes at
him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; snapped the Psammead, with cross
sleepiness.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish I was with the others,&rdquo; said Robert. And the
Psammead began to swell. Robert never thought of wishing the castle and the
siege away. Of course he knew they had all come out of a wish, but swords
and daggers and pikes and lances seemed much too real to be wished away.
Robert lost consciousness
<PB ID="p168" N="168">
for an instant. When he opened his eyes the others were crowding round
him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We never heard you come in,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;How awfully
jolly of you to wish it to give us our wish!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course we understood that was what you&rsquo;d
done.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you ought to have told us. Suppose we&rsquo;d wished
something silly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Silly?&rdquo; said Robert, very crossly indeed. &ldquo;How much
sillier could you have been, I&rsquo;d like to know? You nearly settled
<EMPH>me</EMPH>&mdash;I can tell you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then he told his story, and the others admitted that it certainly had
been rough on him. But they praised his courage and cleverness so much that
he presently got back his lost temper, and felt braver than ever, and
consented to be captain of the besieged force.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done anything yet,&rdquo; said Anthea
comfortably; &ldquo;we waited for you. We&rsquo;re going to shoot at them
through these little loopholes with the bow and arrows uncle gave you, and
you shall have first shot.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would,&rdquo; said Robert
<PB ID="p169" N="169">
cautiously; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re like near to.
They&rsquo;ve got <EMPH>real</EMPH> bows and arrows&mdash;an awful
length&mdash;and swords and pikes and daggers, and all sorts of sharp
things. They&rsquo;re all quite, quite real. It&rsquo;s not just a&mdash;a
picture, or a vision, or anything; they can <EMPH>hurt</EMPH> us &mdash; or
kill us even, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. I can feel my ear all sore still.
Look here&mdash;have you explored the castle? Because I think we&rsquo;d
better let them alone as long as they let us alone. I heard that Jakin man
say they weren&rsquo;t going to attack till just before sun&hyphen;down. We
can be getting ready for the attack. Are there any soldiers in the castle
to defend it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;You see, directly
I&rsquo;d wished we were in a besieged castle, everything seemed to go
upside down, and when it came straight we looked out of the window, and saw
the camp and things and you&mdash;and of course we kept on looking at
everything. Isn&rsquo;t this room jolly? It&rsquo;s as real as
real!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was. It was square, with stone walls four feet thick, and great beams
for ceiling. A
<PB ID="p170" N="170">
low door at the corner led to a flight of steps, up and down. The children
went down; they found themselves in a great arched gatehouse&mdash;the
enormous doors were shut and barred. There was a window in a little room at
the bottom of the round turret up which the stair wound, rather larger than
the other windows, and looking through it they saw that the drawbridge was
up and the portcullis down; the moat looked very wide and deep. Opposite
the great door that led to the moat was another great door, with a little
door in it. The children went through this, and found themselves in a big
paved courtyard, with the great grey walls of the castle rising dark and
heavy on all four sides.</P>
<P>Near the middle of the courtyard stood Martha, moving her right hand
backwards and forwards in the air. The cook was stooping down and moving
her hands, also in a very curious way. But the oddest and at the same time
most terrible thing was the Lamb, who was sitting on nothing, about three
feet from the ground, laughing happily.</P>
<P>The children ran towards him. Just as
<PB ID="p171" N="171">
Anthea was reaching out her arms to take him, Martha said crossly,
&ldquo;Let him alone &mdash; do, miss, when he <EMPH>is</EMPH>
good.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he <EMPH>doing</EMPH>?&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Doing? Why, a&hyphen;setting in his high chair as good as gold, a
precious, watching me doing of the ironing. Get along with you, do&mdash;my
iron&rsquo;s cold again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She went towards the cook and seemed to poke an invisible fire with an
unseen poker&mdash;the cook seemed to be putting an unseen dish into an
invisible oven.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Run along with you do,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
behindhand as it is. You won&rsquo;t get no dinner if you come
a&hyphen;hindering of me like this. Come, off you goes, or I&rsquo;ll pin a
dishcloth to some of your tails.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <EMPH>sure</EMPH> the Lamb&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo;
asked Jane anxiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Right as ninepence, if you don&rsquo;t come unsettling of him. I
thought you&rsquo;d like to be rid of him for to&hyphen;day; but take him,
if you want, for gracious&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they said, and hastened away. They would have to
defend the castle presently,
<PB ID="p172" N="172">
and the Lamb was safer even suspended in mid&hyphen;air in an invisible
kitchen than in the guard&hyphen;room of a besieged castle. They went
through the first doorway they came to and sat down helplessly on a wooden
bench that ran along the room inside.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; said Anthea and Jane together; and Jane added,
&ldquo;I feel as if I was in a mad asylum.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Anthea said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s creepy;
I don&rsquo;t like it. I wish we&rsquo;d wished for something plain&mdash;a
rocking&hyphen;horse, or a donkey, or something.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use wishing <EMPH>now</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert
bitterly; and Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do dry up a sec; I want to think.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He buried his face in his hands, and the others looked about them. They
were in a long room with an arched roof. There were wooden tables along it,
and one across at the end of the room, on a sort of raised platform. The
room was very dim and dark. The floor was strewn with dry things like
sticks, and they did not smell nice.</P>
<P>Cyril sat up suddenly and said&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p173" N="173">
<P>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right. I think it&rsquo;s like
this. You know, we wished that the servants shouldn&rsquo;t notice any
difference when we got wishes. And nothing happens to the Lamb unless we
specially wish it to. So of course they don&rsquo;t notice the castle or
anything. But then the castle is on the same place where our house
was&mdash;is, I mean&mdash;and the servants have to go on being in the
house, or else they <EMPH>would</EMPH> notice. But you can&rsquo;t have a
castle mixed up with our house&mdash;and so <EMPH>we</EMPH> can&rsquo;t see
the house, because we see the castle; and they can&rsquo;t see the castle,
because they go on seeing the house; and so&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>don&rsquo;t!</EMPH>&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;you make
my head go all swimmy, like being on a roundabout. It doesn&rsquo;t matter!
Only, I hope we shall be able to see our dinner, that&rsquo;s
all&mdash;because if it&rsquo;s invisible it&rsquo;ll be unfeelable as
well, and then we can&rsquo;t eat it! I <EMPH>know</EMPH> it will, because
I tried to feel if I could feel the Lamb&rsquo;s chair, and there was
nothing under him at all but air. And we can&rsquo;t eat air, and I feel
just as if I hadn&rsquo;t had any breakfast for years and years.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p174" N="174">
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use thinking about it,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on exploring. Perhaps we might find something to
eat.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This lighted hope in every breast, and they went on exploring the
castle. But though it was the most perfect and delightful castle you can
possibly imagine, and furnished in the most complete and beautiful manner,
neither food nor men&hyphen;at&hyphen;arms were to be found in it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If only you&rsquo;d thought of wishing to be besieged in a castle
thoroughly garrisoned and provisioned!&rdquo; said Jane reproachfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think of everything, you know,&rdquo; said
Anthea. &ldquo;I should think it must be nearly dinner&hyphen;time by
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It wasn&rsquo;t; but they hung about watching the strange movements of
the servants in the middle of the courtyard, because, of course, they
couldn&rsquo;t be sure where the dining&hyphen;room of the invisible house
was. Presently they saw Martha carrying an invisible tray across the
courtyard, for it seemed that, by the most fortunate accident, the
dining&hyphen;room of the house and the banqueting&hyphen;hall of the
castle were the same place.
<PB ID="p175" N="175">
But oh, how their hearts sank when they perceived that the tray
<EMPH>was</EMPH> invisible!</P>
<P>They waited in wretched silence while Martha went through the form of
carving an unseen leg of mutton and serving invisible greens and potatoes
with a spoon that no one could see. When she had left the room, the
children looked at the empty table, and then at each other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This is worse than anything,&rdquo; said Robert, who had not till
now been particularly keen on his dinner.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so very hungry,&rdquo; said Anthea, trying to make
the best of things, as usual.</P>
<P>Cyril tightened his belt ostentatiously. Jane burst into tears.</P>
</DIV0>
<PB ID="p177" N="177">
<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A SIEGE AND BED</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> children were sitting in the gloomy banqueting&hyphen;hall,
at the end of one of the long bare wooden tables. There was now no hope.
Martha had brought in the dinner, and the dinner was invisible, and
unfeelable too; for, when they rubbed their hands along the table, they
knew but too well that for them there was nothing there <EMPH>but</EMPH>
table.</P>
<P>Suddenly Cyril felt in his pocket.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Right, <EMPH>oh!</EMPH>&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look here!
Biscuits.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Rather broken and crumbled, certainly, but still biscuits. Three whole
ones, and a generous handful of crumbs and fragments.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I got them this morning&mdash;cook&mdash;and I&rsquo;d quite
forgotten,&rdquo; he explained as he divided them with scrupulous fairness
into four heaps.</P>
<PB ID="p178" N="178">
<P>They were eaten in happy silence, though they tasted a little oddly,
because they had been in Cyril&rsquo;s pocket all the morning with a hank
of tarred twine, some green fir&hyphen;cones, and a ball of cobbler&rsquo;s
wax.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, but look here, Squirrel,&rdquo; said Robert;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re so clever at explaining about invisibleness and all
that. How is it the biscuits are here, and all the bread and meat and
things have disappeared?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cyril after a pause,
&ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s because <EMPH>we</EMPH> had them. Nothing about
<EMPH>us</EMPH> has changed. Everything&rsquo;s in my pocket all
right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then if we <EMPH>had</EMPH> the mutton it would be real,&rdquo;
said Robert. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I wish we could find it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t find it. I suppose it isn&rsquo;t ours till
we&rsquo;ve got it in our mouths.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or in our pockets,&rdquo; said Jane, thinking of the
biscuits.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who puts mutton in their pockets, goose&hyphen;girl?&rdquo; said
Cyril. &ldquo;But I know&mdash;at any rate, I&rsquo;ll try it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>He leaned over the table with his face about
<PB ID="p179" N="179">
an inch from it, and kept opening and shutting his mouth as if he were
taking bites out of air.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; said Robert in deep dejection.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only&mdash; Hullo!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril stood up with a grin of triumph, holding a square piece of bread
in his mouth. It was quite real. Everyone saw it. It is true that, directly
he bit a piece off, the rest vanished; but it was all right, because he
knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor feel it. He took
another bite from the air between his fingers, and it turned into bread as
he bit. The next moment all the others were following his example, and
opening and shutting their mouths an inch or so from the
bare&hyphen;looking table. Robert captured a slice of mutton, and&mdash;but
I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene. It is
enough to say that they all had enough mutton, and that when Martha came to
change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess in all her born
days.</P>
<P>The pudding was, fortunately, a plain suet roly&hyphen;poly, and in
answer to Martha&rsquo;s
<PB ID="p180" N="180">
questions the children all with one accord said that they would
<EMPH>not</EMPH> have treacle on it&mdash;nor jam, nor
sugar&mdash;&ldquo;Just plain, please,&rdquo; they said. Martha said,
&ldquo;Well, I never&mdash;what next, I wonder!&rdquo; and went away.</P>
<P>Then ensued another scene on which I will not dwell, for nobody looks
nice picking up slices of suet pudding from the table in its mouth, like a
dog.</P>
<P>The great thing, after all, was that they had had dinner; and now
everyone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be
delivered before sunset. Robert, as captain, insisted on climbing to the
top of one of the towers to reconnoitre, so up they all went. And now they
could see all round the castle, and could see, too, that beyond the moat,
on every side, the tents of the besieging party were pitched. Rather
uncomfortable shivers ran down the children&rsquo;s backs as they saw that
all the men were busy cleaning or sharpening their arms,
re&hyphen;stringing their bows, and polishing their shields. A large party
came along the road, with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree;
and
<PB ID="p181" N="181">
Cyril felt quite pale, because he knew this was for a
battering&hyphen;ram.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a good thing we&rsquo;ve got a moat,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;and what a good thing the drawbridge is up&mdash;I should never have
known how to work it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course it would be up in a besieged castle.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think there ought to have been soldiers in it,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see you don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s been
besieged,&rdquo; said Cyril darkly; &ldquo;perhaps most of the brave
defenders were killed quite early in the siege and all the provisions
eaten, and now there are only a few intrepid survivors&mdash;that&rsquo;s
us, and we are going to defend it to the death.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How do you begin&mdash;defending to the death, I mean?&rdquo;
asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We ought to be heavily armed&mdash;and then shoot at them when
they advance to the attack.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They used to pour boiling lead down on besiegers when they got
too close,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Father showed me the holes on purpose
for pouring it down through at Bodiam Castle. And there are holes like it
in the gate&hyphen;tower here.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p182" N="182">
<P>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s only a game; it <EMPH>is</EMPH>
only a game, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>But no one answered.</P>
<P>The children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle, and if they
were armed at all it was soon plain that they would be, as Cyril said,
&ldquo;armed heavily&rdquo;&mdash;for these swords and lances and crossbows
were far too weighty even for Cyril&rsquo;s manly strength; and as for the
longbows, none of the children could even begin to bend them. The daggers
were better; but Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough
for daggers to be of any use.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never mind, we can hurl them like javelins,&rdquo; said Cyril,
&ldquo;or drop them on people&rsquo;s heads. I say&mdash;there are lots of
stones on the other side of the courtyard. If we took some of those up?
Just to drop on their heads if they were to try swimming the
moat.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So a heap of stones grew apace, up in the room above the gate; and
another heap, a shiny spiky dangerous&hyphen;looking heap, of daggers and
knives.</P>
<P>As Anthea was crossing the courtyard for
<PB ID="p183" N="183">
more stones, a sudden and valuable idea came to her.</P>
<P>She went to Martha and said, &ldquo;May we have just biscuits for tea?
We&rsquo;re going to play at besieged castles, and we&rsquo;d like the
biscuits to provision the garrison. Put mine in my pocket, please, my hands
are so dirty. And I&rsquo;ll tell the others to fetch theirs.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was indeed a happy thought, for now with four generous handfuls of
air, which turned to biscuits as Martha crammed it into their pockets, the
garrison was well provisioned till sundown.</P>
<P>They brought up some iron pots of cold water to pour on the besiegers
instead of hot lead, with which the castle did not seem to be provided.</P>
<P>The afternoon passed with wonderful quickness. It was very exciting; but
none of them, except Robert, could feel all the time that this was real
deadly dangerous work. To the others, who had only seen the camp and the
besiegers from a distance, the whole thing seemed half a game of
make&hyphen;believe, and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe
dream.
<PB ID="p184" N="184">
But it was only now and then that Robert could feel this.</P>
<P>When it seemed to be tea&hyphen;time the biscuits were eaten with water
from the deep well in the courtyard, drunk out of horns. Cyril insisted on
putting by eight of the biscuits, in case anyone should feel faint in
stress of battle.</P>
<P>Just as he was putting away the reserve biscuits in a sort of little
stone cupboard without a door, a sudden sound made him drop three. It was
the loud fierce cry of a trumpet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see it <EMPH>is</EMPH> real,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;and
they are going to attack.&rdquo;</P>
<P>All rushed to the narrow windows.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all coming out of
their tents and moving about like ants. There&rsquo;s that Jakin dancing
about where the bridge joins on. I wish he could see me put my tongue out
at him! Yah!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others were far too pale to wish to put their tongues out at
anybody. They looked at Robert with surprised respect. Anthea
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You really <EMPH>are</EMPH> brave, Robert.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; Cyril&rsquo;s pallor turned to redness now, all in a
minute. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been getting ready
<PB ID="p185" N="185">
to be brave all the afternoon. And I wasn&rsquo;t ready, that&rsquo;s all.
I shall be braver than he is in half a jiffy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;what does it matter which of
you is the bravest? I think Cyril was a perfect silly to wish for a castle,
and I don&rsquo;t want to play.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>isn&rsquo;t</EMPH>&rdquo;&mdash;Robert was beginning
sternly, but Anthea interrupted&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes, you do,&rdquo; she said coaxingly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
very nice game, really, because they can&rsquo;t possibly get in, and if
they do the women and children are always spared by civilised
armies.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But are you quite, quite sure they <EMPH>are</EMPH>
civilised?&rdquo; asked Jane, panting. &ldquo;They seem to be such a long
time ago.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course they are.&rdquo; Anthea pointed cheerfully through the
narrow window. &ldquo;Why look at the little flags on their lances, how
bright they are&mdash;and how fine the leader is! Look, that&rsquo;s
him&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it, Robert?&mdash;on the grey horse.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane consented to look, and the scene was almost too pretty to be
alarming. The green turf, the white tents, the flash of pennoned
<PB ID="p186" N="186">
lances, the gleam of armour, and the bright colours of scarf and
tunic&mdash;it was just like a splendid coloured picture. The trumpets were
sounding, and when the trumpets stopped for breath the children could hear
the cling&hyphen;clang of armour and the murmur of voices.</P>
<P>A trumpeter came forward to the edge of the moat, which now seemed very
much narrower than at first, and blew the longest and loudest blast they
had yet heard. When the blaring noise had died away, a man who was with the
trumpeter shouted&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What ho, within there!&rdquo; and his voice came plainly to the
garrison in the gate&hyphen;house.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo there!&rdquo; Robert bellowed back at once.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the name of our Lord the King, and of our good lord and trusty
leader Sir Wulfric de Talbot, we summon this castle to surrender&mdash;on
pain of fire and sword and no quarter. Do ye surrender?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>No</EMPH>,&rdquo; bawled Robert, &ldquo;of course we
don&rsquo;t! Never, <EMPH>Never</EMPH>, <EMPH>NEVER!</EMPH>&rdquo;</P>
<P>The man answered back&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p187" N="187">
<P>&ldquo;Then your fate be on your own heads.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Cheer,&rdquo; said Robert in a fierce whisper. &ldquo;Cheer to
show them we aren&rsquo;t afraid, and rattle the daggers to make more
noise. One, two, three! Hip, hip, hooray! Again&mdash;Hip, hip, hooray! One
more&mdash;Hip, hip, hooray!&rdquo; The cheers were rather high and weak,
but the rattle of the daggers lent them strength and depth.</P>
<P>There was another shout from the camp across the moat&mdash; and then
the beleaguered fortress felt that the attack had indeed begun.</P>
<P>It was getting rather dark in the room above the great gate, and Jane
took a very little courage as she remembered that sunset
<EMPH>couldn&rsquo;t</EMPH> be far off now.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The moat is dreadfully thin,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t get into the castle even if they do swim
over,&rdquo; said Robert. And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair
outside&mdash;heavy feet and the clank of steel. No one breathed for a
moment. The steel and the feet went on up the turret stairs. Then Robert
sprang softly to the door. He pulled off his shoes.</P>
<PB ID="p188" N="188">
<P>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he whispered, and stole quickly and softly
after the boots and the spur&hyphen;clank. He peeped into the upper room.
The man was there&mdash;and it was Jakin, all dripping with
moat&hyphen;water, and he was fiddling about with the machinery which
Robert felt sure worked the drawbridge. Robert banged the door suddenly,
and turned the great key in the lock, just as Jakin sprang to the inside of
the door. Then he tore downstairs and into the little turret at the foot of
the tower where the biggest window was.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We ought to have defended <EMPH>this</EMPH>!&rdquo; he cried to
the others as they followed him. He was just in time. Another man had swum
over, and his fingers were on the window&hyphen;ledge. Robert never knew
how the man had managed to climb up out of the water. But he saw the
clinging fingers, and hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he
caught up from the floor. The man fell with a plop&hyphen;plash into the
moat&hyphen;water. In another moment Robert was outside the little room,
had banged its door and was shooting home the enormous bolts, and calling
to Cyril to lend a hand.</P>
<PB ID="pf188">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five188"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p189" N="189">
<P>Then they stood in the arched gate&hyphen;house, breathing hard and
looking at each other.</P>
<P>Jane&rsquo;s mouth was open.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Cheer up, Jenny,&rdquo; said Robert,&mdash;&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t
last much longer.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a creaking above, and something rattled and shook. The
pavement they stood on seemed to tremble. Then a crash told them that the
drawbridge had been lowered to its place.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that beast Jakin,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still the portcullis; I&rsquo;m almost certain
that&rsquo;s worked from lower down.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And now the drawbridge rang and echoed hollowly to the hoofs of horses
and the tramp of armed men.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Up&mdash;quick!&rdquo; cried Robert. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop
things on them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Even the girls were feeling almost brave now. They followed Robert
quickly, and under his directions began to drop stones out through the long
narrow windows. There was a confused noise below, and some groans.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Anthea, putting down the stone she was just
going to drop out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve hurt
somebody!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p190" N="190">
<P>Robert caught up the stone in a fury.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should just hope we *had!*&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
give something for a jolly good boiling kettle of lead. Surrender,
indeed!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And now came more tramping, and a pause, and then the thundering thump
of the battering&hyphen;ram. And the little room was almost quite dark.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve held it,&rdquo; cried Robert, &ldquo;we
<EMPH>won&rsquo;t</EMPH> surrender! The sun <EMPH>must</EMPH> set in a
minute. Here&mdash;they&rsquo;re all jawing underneath again. Pity
there&rsquo;s no time to get more stones! Here, pour that water down on
them. It&rsquo;s no good, of course, but they&rsquo;ll hate it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think
we&rsquo;d better surrender?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have a parley if
you like, but we&rsquo;ll never surrender. Oh, I&rsquo;ll be a soldier when
I grow up&mdash;you just see if I don&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t go into the
Civil Service, whatever anyone says.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wave a handkerchief and ask for a parley,&rdquo; Jane
pleaded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the sun&rsquo;s going to set
to&hyphen;night at all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Give them the water first&mdash;the brutes!&rdquo;
<PB ID="pf191">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five191"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p191" N="191">
said the bloodthirsty Robert. So Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest
lead&hyphen;hole, and poured. they heard a splash below, but no one below
seemed to have felt it. And again the ram battered the great door. Anthea
paused.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How idiotic,&rdquo; said Robert, lying flat on the floor and
putting one eye to the lead hole. &ldquo;Of course the holes go straight
down into the gate&hyphen;house&mdash;that&rsquo;s for when the enemy has
got past the door and the portcullis, and almost all is lost. Here hand me
the pot.&rdquo; He crawled on to the three&hyphen;cornered
window&hyphen;ledge in the middle of the wall, and, taking the pot from
Anthea, poured the water out through the arrow&hyphen;slit.</P>
<P>And as he began to pour, the noise of the battering&hyphen;ram and the
trampling of the foe and the shouts of &ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;De Talbot for ever!&rdquo; all suddenly stopped and went out like
the snuff of a candle; the little dark room seemed to whirl round and turn
topsy&hyphen;turvy, and when the children came to themselves there they
were safe and sound, in the big front bedroom of their own house&mdash;the
<PB ID="p192" N="192">
house with the ornamental nightmare iron&hyphen;top to the roof.</P>
<P>They all crowded to the window and looked out. The moat and the tents
and the besieging force were all gone&mdash;and there was the garden with
its tangle of dahlias and marigolds and asters and late roses, and the
spiky iron railings and the quiet white road.</P>
<P>Everyone drew a deep breath.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I told you
so! And, I say, we didn&rsquo;t surrender, did we?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad now I wished for a castle?&rdquo; asked
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I think I am <EMPH>now</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Anthea slowly.
&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t wish for it again, I think, Squirrel
dear!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, it was simply splendid!&rdquo; said Jane unexpectedly.
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t frightened a bit.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; Cyril was beginning, but Anthea stopped
him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just come into my
head. This is the very first thing we&rsquo;ve wished for that hasn&rsquo;t
got us into a row. And there hasn&rsquo;t been the least little scrap of a
row
<PB ID="p193" N="193">
about this. Nobody&rsquo;s raging downstairs, we&rsquo;re safe and sound,
we&rsquo;ve had an awfully jolly day&mdash;at least not jolly exactly, but
you know what I mean. And we know now how brave Robert is&mdash; and Cyril
too, of course,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;and Jane as well. And we
haven&rsquo;t got into a row with a single grown&hyphen;up.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The door was opened suddenly and fiercely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&rdquo; said the voice of
Martha, and they could tell by her voice that she was very angry indeed.
&ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t last through the day without getting up
to some doggery! A person can&rsquo;t take a breath of air on the front
doorstep but you must be emptying the wash&hyphen;hand jug on to their
heads! Off you go to bed, the lot of you, and try to get up better children
in the morning. Now then&mdash;don&rsquo;t let me have to tell you twice.
If I find any of you not in bed in ten minutes I&rsquo;ll let you know it,
that&rsquo;s all! A new cap, and everything!&rdquo;</P>
<P>She flounced out amid a disregarded chorus of regrets and apologies. The
children were very sorry, but really it was not their faults. You
can&rsquo;t help it if you are pouring water on a
<PB ID="p194" N="194">
besieging foe, and your castle suddenly changes into your house&mdash;and
everything changes with it except the water, and that happens to fall on
somebody else&rsquo;s clean cap.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why the water didn&rsquo;t change into
nothing, though,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why should it?&rdquo; asked Robert. &ldquo;Water&rsquo;s water
all the world over.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I expect the castle well was the same as ours in the
stable&hyphen;yard,&rdquo; said Jane. And that was really the case.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I thought we couldn&rsquo;t get through a wish&hyphen;day without
a row,&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;it was much too good to be true. Come on,
Bobs, my military hero. If we lick into bed sharp she won&rsquo;t be so
frumious, and perhaps she&rsquo;ll bring us up some supper. I&rsquo;m jolly
hungry! Good&hyphen;night, kids.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good&hyphen;night. I hope the castle won&rsquo;t come creeping
back in the night,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anthea briskly, &ldquo;but
Martha will&mdash;not in the night, but in a minute. Here, turn round,
I&rsquo;ll get that knot out of your pinafore strings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been degrading for Sir
<PB ID="p195" N="195">
Wulfric de Talbot,&rdquo; said Jane dreamily, &ldquo;if he could have known
that half the besieged garrison wore pinafores?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And the other half knickerbockers. Yes&mdash;frightfully. Do
stand still&mdash;you&rsquo;re only tightening the knot,&rdquo; said
Anthea.</P>

<P>&ldquo;<HI>LOOK</HI> here,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an
idea.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Does it hurt much?&rdquo; said Robert sympathetically.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a jackape! I&rsquo;m not humbugging.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shut up, Bobs!&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Silence for the Squirrel&rsquo;s oration,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>Cyril balanced himself on the edge of the water&hyphen;butt in the
backyard, where they all happened to be, and spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Friends, Romans, countrymen&mdash;and women&mdash;we found a
Sammyadd. We have had wishes. We&rsquo;ve had wings, and being beautiful as
the day&mdash;ugh!&mdash;that was pretty jolly beastly if you
like&mdash;and wealth and castles, and that rotten gipsy business with the
Lamb. But
<PB ID="p198" N="198">
we&rsquo;re no forrader. We haven&rsquo;t really got anything worth having
for our wishes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had things happening,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s always something.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough, unless they&rsquo;re the right
things,&rdquo; said Cyril firmly. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve been
thinking&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; whispered Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the silent what&rsquo;s&hyphen;its&hyphen;names of the night.
It&rsquo;s like suddenly being asked something out of history&mdash;the
date of the Conquest or something; you know it all right all the time, but
when you&rsquo;re asked it all goes out of your head. Ladies and gentlemen,
you know jolly well that when we&rsquo;re all rotting about in the usual
way heaps of things keep cropping up, and then real earnest wishes come
into the heads of the beholder&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;&mdash;of the beholder, however stupid he is,&rdquo; Cyril went
on. &ldquo;Why, even Robert might happen to think of a really useful wish
if he didn&rsquo;t injure his poor little brains trying so hard to
think.&mdash;Shut up, Bobs, I tell you!&mdash;You&rsquo;ll have the whole
show over.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p199" N="199">
<P>A struggle on the edge of a water&hyphen;butt is exciting, but damp.
When it was over, and the boys were partially dried, Anthea said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It really was you began it, Bobs. Now honour is satisfied, do let
Squirrel go on. We&rsquo;re wasting the whole morning.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Cyril, still wringing the water out of the
tails of his jacket, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it pax if Bobs will.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Pax then,&rdquo; said Robert sulkily. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got a
lump as big as a cricket ball over my eye.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea patiently offered a dust&hyphen;coloured handkerchief, and Robert
bathed his wounds in silence. &ldquo;Now, Squirrel,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;let&rsquo;s just play bandits, or forts, or
soldiers, or any of the old games. We&rsquo;re dead sure to think of
something if we try not to. You always do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others consented. Bandits was hastily chosen for the game.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as anything else,&rdquo; said Jane gloomily. It
must be owned that Robert was at first but a half&hyphen;hearted bandit,
but when Anthea had borrowed from Martha the red spotted handkerchief in
which
<PB ID="p200" N="200">
the keeper had brought her mushrooms that morning, and had tied up
Robert&rsquo;s head with it so that he could be the wounded hero who had
saved the bandit captain&rsquo;s life the day before, he cheered up
wonderfully. All were soon armed. Bows and arrows slung on the back look
well; and umbrellas and cricket stumps stuck through the belt give a fine
impression of the wearer&rsquo;s being armed to the teeth. The white cotton
hats that men wear in the country nowadays have a very brigandish effect
when a few turkey&rsquo;s feathers are stuck in them. The Lamb&rsquo;s
mail&hyphen;cart was covered with a red&hyphen;and&hyphen;blue checked
tablecloth, and made an admirable baggage&hyphen;waggon. The Lamb asleep
inside of it was not at all in the way. So the banditti set out along the
road that led to the sand&hyphen;pit.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We ought to be near the Sammyadd,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;in
case we think of anything suddenly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It is all very well to make up your minds to play bandits&mdash;or
chess, or ping&hyphen;pong, or any other agreeable game&mdash;but it is not
easy to do it with spirit when all the wonderful
<PB ID="p201" N="201">
wishes you can think of, or can&rsquo;t think of, are waiting for you round
the corner. The game was dragging a little, and some of the bandits were
beginning to feel that the others were disagreeable things, and were saying
so candidly, when the baker&rsquo;s boy came along the road with loaves in
a basket. The opportunity was not one to be lost.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Stand and deliver!&rdquo; cried Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Your money or your life!&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>And they stood on each side of the baker&rsquo;s boy. Unfortunately he
did not seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all. He was a
baker&rsquo;s boy of an unusually large size. He merely said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Chuck it now, d&rsquo;ye hear!&rdquo; and pushed the bandits
aside most disrespectfully.</P>
<P>Then Robert lassoed him with Jane&rsquo;s skipping&hyphen;rope, and
instead of going round his shoulders, as Robert intended, it went round his
feet and tripped him up. The basket was upset, the beautiful new loaves
went bumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road. The girls ran to
pick them up, and all in a moment Robert and the
<PB ID="p202" N="202">
baker&rsquo;s boy were fighting it out, man to man, with Cyril to see fair
play, and the skipping&hyphen;rope twisting round their legs like an
interested snake that wished to be a peace&hyphen;maker. It did not
succeed; indeed the way the boxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters
on the shins and ankles was not at all peace&hyphen;making. I know this is
the second fight&mdash;or contest&mdash;in this chapter, but I can&rsquo;t
help it. It was that sort of day. You know yourself there are days when
rows seem to keep on happening, quite without your meaning them to. If I
were a writer of tales of adventure such as those which used to appear in
<BIBL>The Boys of England</BIBL> when I was young, of course I should be
able to describe the fight, but I cannot do it. I never can see what
happens during a fight, even when it is only dogs. Also, if I had been one
of these <BIBL>Boys of England</BIBL> writers, Robert would have got the
best of it. But I am like George Washington&mdash;I cannot tell a lie, even
about a cherry&hyphen;tree, much less about a fight, and I cannot conceal
from you that Robert was badly beaten, for the second time that
<PB ID="pf203">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five203"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p203" N="203">
day. The baker&rsquo;s boy blacked his other eye, and, being ignorant of
the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly behaviour, he also pulled
Robert&rsquo;s hair, and kicked him on the knee. Robert always used to say
he could have licked the butcher if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the girls. But
I am not sure. Anyway, what happened was this, and very painful it was to
self&hyphen;respecting boys.</P>
<P>Cyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper
style, when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask him
not to go and be beaten too. That &ldquo;too&rdquo; was very nice for
Robert, as you can imagine&mdash;but it was nothing to what he felt when
Anthea rushed in between him and the baker&rsquo;s boy, and caught that
unfair and degraded fighter round the waist, imploring him not to fight any
more.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurt my brother any more!&rdquo; she said in
floods of tears. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;it&rsquo;s only play.
And I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very sorry.&rdquo;</P>
<P>You see how unfair this was to Robert. Because, if the baker&rsquo;s boy
had had any right
<PB ID="p204" N="204">
and chivalrous instincts, and had yielded to Anthea&rsquo;s pleading and
accepted her despicable apology, Robert could not, in honour, have done
anything to him at any future time. But Robert&rsquo;s fears, if he had
any, were soon dispelled. Chivalry was a stranger to the breast of the
baker&rsquo;s boy. He pushed Anthea away very roughly, and he chased Robert
with kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the road to the
sand&hyphen;pit, and there, with one last kick, he landed him in a heap of
sand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll larn you, you young varmint!&rdquo; he said, and went
off to pick up his loaves and go about his business. Cyril, impeded by
Jane, could do nothing without hurting her, for she clung round his legs
with the strength of despair. The baker&rsquo;s boy went off red and damp
about the face; abusive to the last, he called them a pack of silly idiots,
and disappeared round the corner. Then Jane&rsquo;s grasp loosened. Cyril
turned away in silent dignity to follow Robert, and the girls followed him,
weeping without restraint.</P>
<P>It was not a happy party that flung itself
<PB ID="p205" N="205">
down in the sand beside the sobbing Robert. For Robert was
sobbing&mdash;mostly with rage. Though of course I know that a really
heroic boy is always dry&hyphen;eyed after a fight. But then he always
wins, which had not been the case with Robert.</P>
<P>Cyril was angry with Jane; Robert was furious with Anthea; the girls
were miserable; and not one of the four was pleased with the baker&rsquo;s
boy. There was, as French writers say, &ldquo;a silence full of
emotion.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then Robert dug his toes and his hands into the sand and wriggled in his
rage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better wait till I&rsquo;m grown up&mdash;the
cowardly brute! Beast!&mdash;I hate him! But I&rsquo;ll pay him out. Just
because he&rsquo;s bigger than me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You began,&rdquo; said Jane incautiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know I did, silly&mdash;but I was only rotting&mdash;and he
kicked me&mdash;look here&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>Robert tore down a stocking and showed a purple bruise touched up with
red.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I only wish I was bigger than him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He dug his fingers in the sand, and sprang
<PB ID="p206" N="206">
up, for his hand had touched something furry. It was the Psammead, of
course &mdash;&ldquo;On the look&hyphen;out to make sillies of them as
usual,&rdquo; as Cyril remarked later. And of course the next moment
Robert&rsquo;s wish was granted, and he was bigger than the baker&rsquo;s
boy. Oh, but much, much bigger. He was bigger than the big policeman who
used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years ago,&mdash;the one
who was so kind in helping old ladies over the crossing,&mdash;and he was
the biggest man <EMPH>I</EMPH> have ever seen, as well as the kindest. No
one had a foot&hyphen;rule in its pocket, so Robert could not be
measured&mdash;but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on
your mother&rsquo;s head, which I am sure he would never be unkind enough
to do. He must have been ten or eleven feet high, and as broad as a boy of
that height ought to be. His Norfolk suit had fortunately grown too, and
now he stood up in it&mdash;with one of his enormous stockings turned down
to show the gigantic bruise on his vast leg. Immense tears of fury still
stood on his flushed giant face. He looked so surprised, and he was so
large to be
<PB ID="pf207">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five207"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p207" N="207">
wearing an Eton collar, that the others could not help laughing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Sammyadd&rsquo;s done us again,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not us&mdash;<EMPH>me</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;d got any decent feeling you&rsquo;d try to make it make you the
same size. You&rsquo;ve no idea how silly it feels,&rdquo; he added
thoughtlessly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to; I can jolly well see how silly it
looks,&rdquo; Cyril was beginning; but Anthea said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>don&rsquo;t</EMPH>! I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the
matter with you boys to&hyphen;day. Look here, Squirrel, let&rsquo;s play
fair. It is hateful for poor old Bobs, all alone up there. Let&rsquo;s ask
the Sammyadd for another wish, and, if it will, I do really think we ought
to be made the same size.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others agreed, but not gaily; but when they found the Psammead, it
wouldn&rsquo;t.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; it said crossly, rubbing its face with its feet.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rude violent boy, and it&rsquo;ll do him good to be the
wrong size for a bit. What did he want to come digging me out with his
nasty wet hands for? He nearly touched me! He&rsquo;s a perfect savage. A
boy of the Stone Age would have had more sense.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p208" N="208">
<P>Robert&rsquo;s hands had indeed been wet&mdash;with tears.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go away and leave me in peace, do,&rdquo; the Psammead went on.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you don&rsquo;t wish for something sensible
&mdash; something to eat or drink, or good manners, or good tempers. Go
along with you, do!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It almost snarled as it shook its whiskers, and turned a sulky brown
back on them. The most hopeful felt that further parley was vain.</P>
<P>They turned again to the colossal Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Whatever shall we do?&rdquo; they said; and they all said it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Robert grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
reason with that baker&rsquo;s boy. I shall catch him at the end of the
road.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit a chap littler than yourself, old man,&rdquo;
said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do I look like hitting him?&rdquo; said Robert scornfully.
&ldquo;Why, I should <EMPH>kill</EMPH> him. But I&rsquo;ll give him
something to remember. Wait till I pull up my stocking.&rdquo; He pulled up
his stocking, which was as large as a small bolster&hyphen;case, and strode
off. His strides
<PB ID="pf209">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five209"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p209" N="209">
were six or seven feet long, so that it was quite easy for him to be at the
bottom of the hill, ready to meet the baker&rsquo;s boy when he came down
swinging the empty basket to meet his master&rsquo;s cart, which had been
leaving bread at the cottages along the road.</P>
<P>Robert crouched behind a haystack in the farmyard, that is at the
corner, and when he heard the boy come whistling along he jumped out at him
and caught him by the collar.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was about four times its usual
size, just as his body was four times its, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to teach
you to kick boys smaller than you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He lifted up the baker&rsquo;s boy and set him on the top of the
haystack, which was about sixteen feet from the ground, and then he sat
down on the roof of the cowshed and told the baker&rsquo;s boy exactly what
he thought of him. I don&rsquo;t think the boy heard it all&mdash;he was in
a sort of trance of terror. When Robert has said everything he could think
of, and some things twice over, he shook the boy and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And now get down the best way you can,&rdquo; and left him.</P>
<PB ID="p210" N="210">
<P>I don&rsquo;t know how the baker&rsquo;s boy got down, but I do know
that he missed the cart, and got into the very hottest of hot water when he
turned up at last at the bakehouse. I am sorry for him, but, after all, it
was quite right that he should be taught that English boys mustn&rsquo;t
use their feet when they fight, but their fists. Of course the water he got
into only became hotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he
had licked and the giant as high as a church, because no one could possibly
believe such a tale as that. Next day the tale was believed&mdash;but that
was too late to be of any use to the baker&rsquo;s boy.</P>
<P>When Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden. Anthea had
thoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there&mdash;because
the dining&hyphen;room was rather small, and it would have been so awkward
to have a brother the size of Robert in there. The Lamb, who had slept
peacefully during the whole stormy morning, was now found to be sneezing,
and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And really it&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; said Cyril,
<PB ID="p211" N="211">
&ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d ever have stopped screaming if
he&rsquo;d once seen you the awful size you are!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert was indeed what a draper would call an
&ldquo;out&hyphen;size&rdquo; in boys. He found himself able to step right
over the iron gate in the front garden.</P>
<P>Martha brought out the dinner&mdash;it was cold veal and baked potatoes,
with sago pudding and stewed plums to follow.</P>
<P>She of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual
size, and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more. You
have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you are many
times your proper size. Robert groaned, and asked for more bread. But
Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever. She was in a hurry,
because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst Fair, and she
wished to be dressed smartly before he came.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish <EMPH>we</EMPH> were going to the Fair,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go anywhere that size,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<PB ID="p212" N="212">
<P>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;They have giants at fairs,
much bigger ones than me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not much, they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cyril was beginning, when Jane
screamed &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; with such loud suddenness that they all thumped
her on the back and asked whether she had swallowed a
plum&hyphen;stone.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, breathless from being thumped,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a plum&hyphen;stone. It&rsquo;s an
idea. Let&rsquo;s take Robert to the Fair, and get them to give us money
for showing him! Then we really <EMPH>shall</EMPH> get something out of the
old Sammyadd at last!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take me indeed!&rdquo; said Robert indignantly. &ldquo;Much more
likely me take you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And so it turned out. The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but
Robert, and even he was brought round by Anthea&rsquo;s suggestion that he
should have a double share of any money they might make. There was a little
old pony&hyphen;trap in the coach&hyphen;house&mdash;the kind that is
called a governess&hyphen;cart. It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as
quickly as possible, so Robert&mdash; who could now take enormous steps and
so go very fast indeed&mdash;
<PB ID="pf213">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five213"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p213" N="213">
consented to wheel the others in this. It was as easy to him now as
wheeling the Lamb in the mail&hyphen;cart had been in the morning. The
Lamb&rsquo;s cold prevented his being of the party.</P>
<P>It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a pony&hyphen;carriage by a
giant. Everyone enjoyed the journey except Robert and the few people they
passed on the way. These mostly went into what looked like some kind of
standing&hyphen;up fits by the roadside, as Anthea said. Just outside
Benenhurst, Robert hid in a barn, and the others went on to the Fair.</P>
<P>There were some swings, and a hooting&hyphen;tooting blaring
merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round, and a shooting&hyphen;gallery and
cocoanut&hyphen;shies. Resisting an impulse to win a cocoanut,&mdash;or at
least to attempt the enterprise,&mdash;Cyril went up to the woman who was
loading little guns before the array of glass bottles on strings against a
sheet of canvas.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here you are, little gentleman!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Penny a
shot!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we are here on business,
not on pleasure. Who&rsquo;s the master?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p214" N="214">
<P>&ldquo;The master&mdash;the head&mdash;the boss of the show.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a stout man in a dirty
linen jacket who was sleeping in the sun; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t advise
you to wake him sudden. His temper&rsquo;s contrary, especially these hot
days. Better have a shot while you&rsquo;re waiting.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather important,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be very profitable to him. I think he&rsquo;ll be sorry
if we take it away.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s money in his pocket,&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;No kid now? What is it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <EMPH>giant</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You <EMPH>are</EMPH> kidding?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come along and see,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>The woman looked doubtfully at them, then she called to a ragged little
girl in striped stockings and a dingy white petticoat that came below her
brown frock, and leaving her in charge of the
&ldquo;shooting&hyphen;gallery&rdquo; she turned to Anthea and said,
&ldquo;Well, hurry up! But if you <EMPH>are</EMPH> kidding, you&rsquo;d
best say so. I&rsquo;m as mild as milk myself, but my Bill he&rsquo;s a
fair terror and&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p215" N="215">
<P>Anthea led the way to the barn. &ldquo;It really <EMPH>is</EMPH> a
giant,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a giant little boy&mdash;in
Norfolks like my brother&rsquo;s there. And we didn&rsquo;t bring him up to
the Fair because people do stare so, and they seem to go into kind of
standing&hyphen;up fits when they see him. And we thought perhaps
you&rsquo;d like to show him and get pennies; and if you like to pay us
something, you can&mdash;only, it&rsquo;ll have to be rather a lot, because
we promised him he should have a double share of whatever we
made.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The woman murmured something indistinct, of which the children could
only hear the words, &ldquo;Swelp me!&rdquo; &ldquo;balmy,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;crumpet,&rdquo; which conveyed no definite idea to their minds.</P>
<P>She had taken Anthea&rsquo;s hand, and was holding it very firmly; and
Anthea could not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have
wandered off or turned his proper size during the interval. But she knew
that the Psammead&rsquo;s gifts really did last till sunset, however
inconvenient their lasting might be; and she did not think somehow,
<PB ID="p216" N="216">
that Robert would care to go out alone while he was that size.</P>
<P>When they reached the barn and Cyril called &ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; there
was a stir among the loose hay, and Robert began to come out. His hand and
arm came first&mdash;then a foot and leg. When the woman saw the hand she
said &ldquo;My!&rdquo; but when she saw the foot she said &ldquo;Upon my
civvy!&rdquo; and when, by slow and heavy degrees, the whole of
Robert&rsquo;s enormous bulk was at last completely disclosed, she drew a
long breath and began to say many things, compared with which
&ldquo;balmy&rdquo; and &ldquo;crumpet&rdquo; seemed quite ordinary. She
dropped into understandable English at last.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you take for him?&rdquo; she said excitedly.
&ldquo;Anything in reason. We&rsquo;d have a special van
built&mdash;leastways, I know where there&rsquo;s a second&hyphen;hand one
would do up handsome&mdash;what a baby elephant had, as died. What&rsquo;ll
you take? He&rsquo;s soft, ain&rsquo;t he? Them giants mostly is&mdash;but
I never see&mdash;no never! What&rsquo;ll you take? Down on the nail.
We&rsquo;ll treat him like a king,
<PB ID="p217" N="217">
and give him first&hyphen;rate grub and a doss fit for a bloomin&rsquo;
dook. He must be dotty or he wouldn&rsquo;t need you kids to cart him
about. What&rsquo;ll you take for him?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take anything,&rdquo; said Robert sternly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more soft than you are&mdash;not so much, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. I&rsquo;ll come and be a show for to&hyphen;day if
you&rsquo;ll give me&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated at the enormous price he was
about to ask&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll give me fifteen
shillings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the woman, so quickly that Robert felt he had
been unfair to himself, and wished he had asked thirty. &ldquo;Come on
now&mdash;and see my Bill&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll fix a price for the season.
I dessay you might get as much as two quid a week reg&rsquo;lar. Come
on&mdash;and make yourself as small as you can, for gracious&rsquo;
sake!&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was not very small, and a crowd gathered quickly, so that it was at
the head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled
meadow where the Fair was held, and passed over the stubbly yellow dusty
grass to the door of the biggest tent.
<PB ID="p218" N="218">
He crept in, and the woman went to call her Bill. He was the big sleeping
man, and he did not seem at all pleased at being awakened. Cyril, watching
through a slit in the tent, saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a
sleepy head. Then the woman went on speaking very fast. Cyril heard
&ldquo;Strewth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;biggest draw you ever, so help me!&rdquo;
and he began to share Robert&rsquo;s feeling that fifteen shillings was
indeed far too little. Bill slouched up to the tent and entered. When he
beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert he said but
little,&mdash;&ldquo;Strike me pink!&rdquo; were the only words the
children could afterwards remember,&mdash;but he produced fifteen
shillings, mainly in sixpences and coppers, and handed it to Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix up about what you&rsquo;re to draw when the
show&rsquo;s over to&hyphen;night,&rdquo; he said with hoarse heartiness.
&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; love a duck! you&rsquo;ll be that happy with us
you&rsquo;ll never want to leave us. Can you do a song now&mdash;or a bit
of a breakdown?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not to&hyphen;day,&rdquo; said Robert, rejecting the
<PB ID="p219" N="219">
idea of trying to sing &ldquo;As once in May,&rdquo; a favourite of his
mother&rsquo;s, and the only song he could think of at the moment.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Get Levi and clear them bloomin&rsquo; photos out. Clear the
tent. Stick up a curtain or suthink,&rdquo; the man went on.
&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, what a pity we ain&rsquo;t got no tights his size ! But
we&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em before the week&rsquo;s out. Young man, your
fortune&rsquo;s made. It&rsquo;s a good thing you came to me, and not to
some chaps as I could tell you on. I&rsquo;ve known blokes as beat their
giants, and starved &rsquo;em too; so I&rsquo;ll tell you straight,
you&rsquo;re in luck this day if you never was afore. &rsquo;Cos I&rsquo;m
a lamb, I am&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t deceive you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anyone&rsquo;s beating
<EMPH>me</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert, looking down on the
&ldquo;lamb.&rdquo; Robert was crouched on his knees, because the tent was
not big enough for him to stand upright in, but even in that position he
could still look down on most people. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m awfully
hungry&mdash;I wish you&rsquo;d get me something to eat.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, &rsquo;Becca,&rdquo; said hoarse Bill. &ldquo;Get him some
grub&mdash; the best you&rsquo;ve got, mind!&rdquo;
<PB ID="p220" N="220">
Another whisper followed, of which the children only heard, &ldquo;Down in
black and white&mdash;first thing to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then the woman went to get the food&mdash;it was only bread and cheese
when it came, but it was delightful to the large and empty Robert; and the
man went to post sentinels round the tent, to give the alarm if Robert
should attempt to escape with his fifteen shillings.</P>
<P>&ldquo;As if we weren&rsquo;t honest,&rdquo; said Anthea indignantly
when the meaning of the sentinels dawned on her.</P>
<P>Then began a very strange and wonderful afternoon.</P>
<P>Bill was a man who knew his business. In a very little while, the
photographic views, the spyglasses you look at them through so that they
really seem rather real, and the lights you see them by, were all packed
away. A curtain&mdash;it was an old red&hyphen;and&hyphen;black carpet
really&mdash;was run across the tent. Robert was concealed behind, and Bill
was standing on a trestle&hyphen;table outside the tent making a speech. It
was rather a good speech. It began by
<PB ID="p221" N="221">
saying that the giant it was his privilege to introduce to the public that
day was the eldest son of the Emperor of San Francisco, compelled through
an unfortunate love affair with the Duchess of the Fiji Islands to leave
his own country and take refuge in England&mdash;the land of
liberty&mdash;where freedom was the right of every man, no matter how big
he was. It ended by the announcement that the first twenty who came to the
tent door should see the giant for threepence apiece. &ldquo;After
that,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;the price is riz, and I don&rsquo;t
undertake to say what it won&rsquo;t be riz to. So now&rsquo;s yer
time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>A young man squiring his sweetheart on her afternoon out was the first
to come forward. For that occasion his was the princely attitude&mdash;no
expense spared&mdash;money no object. His girl wished to see the giant?
Well, she should see the giant, even though seeing the giant cost
threepence each and the other entertainments were all penny ones.</P>
<P>The flap of the tent was raised&mdash;the couple entered. Next moment a
wild shriek from the girl thrilled all present. Bill
<PB ID="p222" N="222">
slapped his leg. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s done the trick!&rdquo; he whispered to
&rsquo;Becca. It was indeed a splendid advertisement of the charms of
Robert. When the girl came out she was pale and trembling, and a crowd was
round the tent.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; asked a bailiff.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;horrid!&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as big as a barn, and that fierce. It froze the
blood in my bones. I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; missed seeing it for
anything.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The fierceness was only caused by Robert&rsquo;s trying not to laugh.
But the desire to do that soon left him, and before sunset he was more
inclined to cry than to laugh, and more inclined to sleep than either. For,
by ones and twos and threes people kept coming in all the afternoon, and
Robert had to shake hands with those who wished it, and to allow himself to
be punched and pulled and patted and thumped, so that people might make
sure he was really real.</P>
<P>The other children sat on a bench and watched and waited, and were very
bored
<PB ID="pf222">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five222"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="pf223">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five223"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p223" N="223">
indeed. It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning money
that could have been invented. And only fifteen shillings! Bill had taken
four times that already, for the news of the giant had spread, and
tradespeople in carts, and gentlepeople in carriages, came from far and
near. One gentleman with an eyeglass, and a very large yellow rose in his
buttonhole, offered Robert, in an obliging whisper ten pounds a week to
appear at the Crystal Palace. Robert had to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said regretfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no
use promising what you can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, poor fellow, bound for a term of years, I suppose! Well,
here&rsquo;s my card; when your time&rsquo;s up come to me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I will&mdash;if I&rsquo;m the same size then,&rdquo; said Robert
truthfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you grow a bit, so much the better,&rdquo; said the
gentleman.</P>
<P>When he had gone, Robert beckoned Cyril and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell them I must and will have an easy. And I want my
tea.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p224" N="224">
<P>Tea was provided, and a paper hastily pinned on the tent. It
said&mdash;</P>
<P>CLOSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE THE GIANT GETS HIS TEA.</P>
<P>Then there was a hurried council.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How am I to get away?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about it all the afternoon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, walk out when the sun sets and you&rsquo;re your right size.
They can&rsquo;t do anything to us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert opened his eyes. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;d nearly kill us,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;when they saw me get my right size. No, we must think of
some other way. We <EMPH>must</EMPH> be alone when the sun sets.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Cyril briskly, and he went to the door,
outside which Bill was smoking a clay pipe and talking in a low voice to
&rsquo;Becca. Cyril heard him say&mdash;&ldquo;Good as havin&rsquo; a
fortune left you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;you can let people come in
again in a minute. He&rsquo;s nearly finished his tea. But he
<EMPH>must</EMPH> be left alone when the sun sets. He&rsquo;s very queer at
that
<PB ID="p225" N="225">
time of day, and if he&rsquo;s worried I won&rsquo;t answer for the
consequences.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what comes over him?&rdquo; asked Bill.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sort of a
<EMPH>change</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril candidly. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t at
all like himself&mdash;you&rsquo;d hardly know him. He&rsquo;s very queer
indeed. Someone&rsquo;ll get hurt if he&rsquo;s not alone about
sunset.&rdquo; This was true.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pull round for the evening, I
s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;half an hour after sunset he&rsquo;ll be quite
himself again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Best to humour him,&rdquo; said the woman.</P>
<P>And so, at what Cyril judged was about half an hour before sunset, the
tent was again closed, &ldquo;whilst the giant gets his supper.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The crowd was very merry about the giant&rsquo;s meals and their coming
so close together.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, he can pick a bit,&rdquo; Bill owned. &ldquo;You see he has
to eat hearty, being the size he is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Inside the tent the four children breathlessly arranged a plan of
retreat.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You go <EMPH>now</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril to the girls,
&ldquo;and get along home as fast as you can. Oh, never mind the beastly
pony&hyphen;cart; we&rsquo;ll get that to&hyphen;
<PB ID="p226" N="226">
morrow. Robert and I are dressed the same. We&rsquo;ll manage somehow, like
Sydney Carton did. Only, you girls <EMPH>must</EMPH> get out, or it&rsquo;s
all no go. We can run, but you can&rsquo;t&mdash;whatever you may think.
No, Jane, it&rsquo;s no good Robert going out and knocking people down. The
police would follow him till he turned his proper size, and then arrest him
like a shot. Go you must! If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll never speak to you
again. It was you got us into this mess really, hanging round
people&rsquo;s legs the way you did this morning. <EMPH>Go</EMPH>, I tell
you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And Jane and Anthea went.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home,&rdquo; they said to Bill.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving the giant with you. Be kind to him.&rdquo; And
that, as Anthea said afterwards, was very deceitful, but what were they to
do?</P>
<P>When they had gone, Cyril went to Bill.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he wants some ears of
corn&mdash;there&rsquo;s some in the next field but one. I&rsquo;ll just
run and get it. Oh, and he says can&rsquo;t you loop up the tent at the
back a bit? He says he&rsquo;s stifling for a breath of air. I&rsquo;ll see
no one peeps in at him. I&rsquo;ll cover him up, and he can take a nap
while I go for the corn.
<PB ID="p227" N="227">
He *will* have it&mdash;there&rsquo;s no holding him when he gets like
this.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The giant was made comfortable with a heap of sacks and an old
tarpaulin. The curtain was looped up, and the brothers were left alone.
They matured their plans in whispers. Outside, the
merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round blared out its comic tunes, screaming now and
then to attract public notice.</P>
<P>Half a minute after the sun had set, a boy in a Norfolk suit came out
past Bill.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off for the corn,&rdquo; he said, and mingled quickly
with the crowd.</P>
<P>At the same instant a boy came out of the back of the tent past
&rsquo;Becca, posted there as sentinel.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off after the corn,&rdquo; said this boy also. And he,
too moved away quietly and was lost in the crowd. The front&hyphen;door boy
was Cyril; the back&hyphen;door was Robert&mdash;now, since sunset, once
more his proper size. They walked quickly through the field, and along the
road, where Robert caught Cyril up. Then they ran. They were home as soon
as the girls were, for it was a long way, and they ran most
<PB ID="p228" N="228">
of it. It was indeed a <EMPH>very</EMPH> long way, as they found when they
had to go and drag the pony&hyphen;trap home next morning, with no enormous
Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a mail&hyphen;cart, and they were
babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid.</P>
<P>*   *   *   *   *   *</P>
<P>I cannot possibly tell you what Bill and &rsquo;Becca said when they
found that the giant had gone. For one thing, I do not know.</P>

<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GROWN UP</HEAD>
<P><HI>CYRIL</HI> had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of
occasions on which a wish would be most useful. And this thought filled his
mind when he happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after
Robert had wished to be bigger than the baker&rsquo;s boy, and had been it.
The day that lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by
getting the governess&hyphen;cart home from Benenhurst.</P>
<P>Cyril dressed hastily; he did not take a bath, because tin baths are so
noisy, and he had no wish to rouse Robert, and he slipped off alone, as
Anthea had once done, and ran through the dewy morning to the
sand&hyphen;pit. He dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly, and
began the conversation by asking
<PB ID="p230" N="230">
it whether it still felt any ill effects from the contact with the tears of
Robert the day before yesterday. The Psammead was in a good temper. It
replied politely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And now, what can I do for you?&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;ve come here so early to ask for something for
yourself&mdash;something your brothers and sisters aren&rsquo;t to know
about, eh? Now, do be persuaded for your own good! Ask for a good fat
Megatherium and have done with it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;not to&hyphen;day, I think,&rdquo; said Cyril
cautiously. &ldquo;What I really wanted to say was&mdash;you know how
you&rsquo;re always wishing for things when you&rsquo;re playing at
anything?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I seldom play,&rdquo; said the Psammead coldly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, you know what I mean,&rdquo; Cyril went on impatiently.
&ldquo;What I want to say is&colon; won&rsquo;t you let us have our wish
just when we think of it, and just where we happen to be? So that we
don&rsquo;t have to come and disturb you again,&rdquo; added the crafty
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only end in your wishing for something you
don&rsquo;t really want, like you did about the castle,&rdquo; said the
Psammead, stretching its brown
<PB ID="pf230">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five230"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p231" N="231">
arms and yawning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the same since people left off
eating really wholesome things. However, have it your own way.
Good&hyphen;bye.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good&hyphen;bye,&rdquo; said Cyril politely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; said the Psammead suddenly,
shooting out its long snail&rsquo;s eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
tired of you&mdash;all of you. You have no more sense than so many oysters.
Go along with you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And Cyril went.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What an awful long time babies <EMPH>stay</EMPH> babies,&rdquo;
said Cyril after the Lamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he
wasn&rsquo;t noticing, and with coos and clucks of naughty rapture had
opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden spade, and when even
immersion in a wash&hyphen;hand basin had failed to wash the mould from the
works and make the watch go again. Cyril had said several things in the
heat of the moment; but now he was calmer, and had even consented to carry
the Lamb part of the way to the woods. Cyril had persuaded the others to
agree to his plan, and not to wish for anything more till they really did
wish it. Meantime it seemed good to go
<PB ID="p232" N="232">
to the woods for nuts, and on the mossy grass under a sweet
chestnut&hyphen;tree the five were sitting. The Lamb was pulling up the
moss by fat handfuls, and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of his
watch.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He does grow,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t oo,
precious?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Me grow,&rdquo; said the Lamb cheerfully&mdash;&ldquo;me grow big
boy, have guns an&rsquo;
mouses&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash; Imagination or
vocabulary gave out here. But anyway it was the longest speech the Lamb had
ever made, and it charmed everyone, even Cyril, who tumbled the Lamb over
and rolled him in the moss to the music of delighted squeals.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll be grown up some day,&rdquo; Anthea was
saying, dreamily looking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the
long straight chestnut&hyphen;leaves. But at that moment the Lamb,
struggling gaily with Cyril, thrust a stoutly&hyphen;shod little foot
against his brother&rsquo;s chest; there was a crack!&mdash;the innocent
Lamb had broken the glass of father&rsquo;s second&hyphen;best Waterbury
watch, which Cyril had borrowed without leave.</P>
<PB ID="pf232">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five232"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p233" N="233">
<P>&ldquo;Grow up some day!&rdquo; said Cyril bitterly, plumping the Lamb
down on the grass. &ldquo;I daresay he will&mdash;when nobody wants him to.
I wish to goodness he would&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Oh</EMPH>, take care!&rdquo; cried Anthea in an agony of
apprehension. But it was too late&mdash;like music to a song her words and
Cyril&rsquo;s came out together&mdash;</P>
<P>Anthea&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, take care!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril&mdash;&ldquo;Grow up now!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The faithful Psammead was true to its promise, and there, before the
horrified eyes of its brothers and sisters, the Lamb suddenly and violently
grew up. It was the most terrible moment. The change was not so sudden as
the wish&hyphen;changes usually were. The Baby&rsquo;s face changed first.
It grew thinner and larger, lines came in the forehead, the eyes grew more
deep&hyphen;set and darker in colour, the mouth grew longer and thinner;
most terrible of all, a little dark moustache appeared on the lip of one
who was still&mdash;except as to the face&mdash;a
two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old baby in a linen smock and white open&hyphen;work
socks.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I wish it wouldn&rsquo;t! Oh, I wish it
<PB ID="p234" N="234">
wouldn&rsquo;t! You boys might wish as well!&rdquo; They all wished hard,
for the sight was enough to dismay the most heartless. They all wished so
hard, indeed, that they felt giddy and almost lost consciousness; but the
wishing was quite vain, for, when the wood ceased to whirl round, their
dazzled eyes were riveted at once by the spectacle of a very
proper&hyphen;looking young man in flannels and a straw hat&mdash;a young
man who wore the same little black moustache which just before they had
actually seen growing upon the Baby&rsquo;s lip. This, then, was the
Lamb&mdash;grown up! Their own Lamb! It was a terrible moment. The
grown&hyphen;up Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself
against the trunk of the sweet chestnut. He tilted the straw hat over his
eyes. He was evidently weary. He was going to sleep. The Lamb&mdash;the
original little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times and
in unexpected places. Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and the
pale green necktie like the other Lamb? or had his mind grown up together
with his body?</P>
<P>That was the question which the others, in
<PB ID="pf234">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five234"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p235" N="235">
a hurried council held among the yellowing bracken a few yards from the
sleeper, debated eagerly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Whichever it is, it&rsquo;ll be just as awful,&rdquo; said
Anthea. &ldquo;If his inside senses are grown up too, he won&rsquo;t stand
our looking after him; and if he&rsquo;s still a baby inside of him how on
earth are we to get him to do anything? And it&rsquo;ll be getting on for
dinner&hyphen;time in a minute&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t got any nuts,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, bother nuts!&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;but dinner&rsquo;s
different&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have half enough dinner yesterday.
Couldn&rsquo;t we tie him to the tree and go home to our dinners and come
back afterwards?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A fat lot of dinner we should get if we went back without the
Lamb!&rdquo; said Cyril in scornful misery. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll be just
the same if we go back with him in the state he is now. Yes, I know
it&rsquo;s my doing; don&rsquo;t rub it in! I know I&rsquo;m a beast, and
not fit to live; you can take that for settled, and say no more about it.
The question is, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p236" N="236">
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wake him up, and take him into Rochester or Maidstone
and get some grub at a pastrycook&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Robert
hopefully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take him?&rdquo; repeated Cyril. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;do! It&rsquo;s
all my fault&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deny that&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll find
you&rsquo;ve got your work cut out for you if you try to take that young
man anywhere. The Lamb always was spoilt, but now he&rsquo;s grown up
he&rsquo;s a demon&mdash;simply. I can see it. Look at his
mouth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s wake him up and
see what <EMPH>he&rsquo;ll</EMPH> do. Perhaps <EMPH>he&rsquo;ll</EMPH> take
<EMPH>us</EMPH> to Maidstone and stand Sam. He ought to have a lot of money
in the pockets of those extra&hyphen;special bags. We <EMPH>must</EMPH>
have dinner, anyway.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They drew lots with little bits of bracken. It fell to Jane&rsquo;s lot
to waken the grown&hyphen;up Lamb.</P>
<P>She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of wild honeysuckle.
He said &ldquo;Bother the flies!&rdquo; twice, and then opened his
eyes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo, kiddies!&rdquo; he said in a languid tone, &ldquo;still
here? What&rsquo;s the giddy hour? You&rsquo;ll be late for your
grub!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p237" N="237">
<P>&ldquo;I know we shall,&rdquo; said Robert bitterly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then cut along home,&rdquo; said the grown&hyphen;up Lamb.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What about your grub, though?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, how far is it to the station, do you think? I&rsquo;ve a sort
of notion that I&rsquo;ll run up to town and have some lunch at the
club.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Blank misery fell like a pall on the four others. The
Lamb&mdash;alone&mdash;unattended&mdash;would go to town and have lunch at
a club! Perhaps he would also have tea there. Perhaps sunset would come
upon him amid the dazzling luxury of club&hyphen;land, and a helpless cross
sleepy baby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters, and would
wail miserably for &ldquo;Panty&rdquo; from the depths of a club
arm&hyphen;chair ! The picture moved Anthea almost to tears.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh no, Lamb ducky, you mustn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; she cried
incautiously.</P>
<P>The grown&hyphen;up Lamb frowned. &ldquo;My dear Anthea,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;how often am I to tell you that my name is Hilary or St. Maur or
Devereux?&mdash;any of my baptismal names are
<PB ID="p238" N="238">
free to my little brothers and sisters, but <EMPH>not</EMPH>
&lsquo;Lamb&rsquo;&mdash;a relic of foolish and far&hyphen;off
childhood.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was awful. He was their elder brother now, was he? Well, of course
he was, if he was grown up&mdash;since they weren&rsquo;t. Thus, in
whispers, Anthea and Robert.</P>
<P>But the almost daily adventures resulting from the Psammead wishes were
making the children wise beyond their years.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dear Hilary,&rdquo; said Anthea, and the others choked at the
name, &ldquo;you know father didn&rsquo;t wish you to go to London. He
wouldn&rsquo;t like us to be left alone without you to take care of us. Oh,
deceitful beast that I am!&rdquo; she added to herself.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re our elder
brother, why not behave as such and take us over to Maidstone and give us a
jolly good blow&hyphen;out, and we&rsquo;ll go on the river
afterwards?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m infinitely obliged to you,&rdquo; said the Lamb
courteously, &ldquo;but I should prefer solitude. Go home to your
lunch&mdash;I mean your dinner. Perhaps I may look in about
<PB ID="pf239">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five239"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p239" N="239">
tea&hyphen;time&mdash;or I may not be home till after you are in your
beds.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Their beds! Speaking glances flashed between the wretched four. Much bed
there would be for them if they went home without the Lamb.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We promised mother not to lose sight of you if we took you
out,&rdquo; Jane said before the others could stop her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here, Jane,&rdquo; said the grown&hyphen;up Lamb, putting
his hands in his pockets and looking down at her, &ldquo;little girls
should be seen and not heard. You kids must learn not to make yourselves a
nuisance. Run along home now&mdash;and perhaps, if you&rsquo;re good,
I&rsquo;ll give you each a penny to&hyphen;morrow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, in the best &ldquo;man to
man&rdquo; tone at his command, &ldquo;where are you going, old man? You
might let Bobs and me come with you&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t want the
girls.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was really rather noble of Cyril, for he never did care much about
being seen in public with the Lamb, who of course after sunset would be a
baby again.</P>
<PB ID="p240" N="240">
<P>The &ldquo;man to man&rdquo; tone succeeded.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I shall just run over to Maidstone on my bike,&rdquo; said the
new Lamb airily, fingering the little black moustache. &ldquo;I can lunch
at The Crown&mdash;and perhaps I&rsquo;ll have a pull on the river; but I
can&rsquo;t take you all on the machine&mdash;now, can I? Run along home,
like good children.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The position was desperate. Robert exchanged a despairing look with
Cyril. Anthea detached a pin from her waistband, a pin whose withdrawal
left a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice, and handed it furtively to
Robert&mdash;with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning. Robert
slipped away to the road. There, sure enough, stood a bicycle&mdash;a
beautiful new free&hyphen;wheel. Of course Robert understood at once that
if the Lamb was grown up he <EMPH>must</EMPH> have a bicycle. This had
always been one of Robert&rsquo;s own reasons for wishing to be grown up.
He hastily began to use the pin&mdash;eleven punctures in the back tyre,
seven in the front. He would have made the total twenty&hyphen;two but for
the rustling of the yellow hazel&hyphen;leaves, which warned him of
<PB ID="pf240">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five240"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p241" N="241">
the approach of the others. He hastily leaned a hand on the wheel, and was
rewarded by the &ldquo;whish&rdquo; of what was left of the air escaping
from eighteen neat pin&hyphen;holes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Your bike&rsquo;s run down,&rdquo; said Robert, wondering how he
could so soon have learned to deceive.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a puncture,&rdquo; said Anthea, stooping down, and
standing up again with a thorn which she had got ready for the purpose.
&ldquo;Look here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The grown&hyphen;up Lamb (or Hilary, as I suppose one must now call him)
fixed his pump and blew up the tyre. The punctured state of it was soon
evident.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s a cottage somewhere near&mdash;where one
could get a pail of water?&rdquo; said the Lamb.</P>
<P>There was; and when the number of punctures had been made manifest, it
was felt to be a special blessing that the cottage provided &ldquo;teas for
cyclists&rdquo;. It provided an odd sort of tea&hyphen;and&hyphen;hammy
meal for the Lamb and his brothers. This was paid for out of
<PB ID="p242" N="242">
the fifteen shillings which had been earned by Robert when he was a
giant&mdash;for the Lamb, it appeared, had unfortunately no money about
him. This was a great disappointment for the others; but it is a thing that
will happen, even to the most grown&hyphen;up of us. However, Robert had
enough to eat, and that was something. Quietly but persistently the
miserable four took it in turns to try to persuade the Lamb (or St. Maur)
to spend the rest of the day in the woods. There was not very much of the
day left by the time he had mended the eighteenth puncture. He looked up
from the completed work with a sigh of relief, and suddenly put his tie
straight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady coming,&rdquo; he said
briskly&mdash;&ldquo;for goodness&rsquo; sake, get out of the way. Go
home&mdash;hide&mdash;vanish somehow! I can&rsquo;t be seen with a pack of
dirty kids.&rdquo; His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty,
because, earlier in the day, the Lamb, in his infant state, had sprinkled a
good deal of garden soil over them. The grown&hyphen;up Lamb&rsquo;s voice
was so tyrant&hyphen;like, as Jane said afterwards, that they
<PB ID="p243" N="243">
actually retreated to the back garden, and left him with his little
moustache and his flannel suit to meet alone the young lady, who now came
up the front garden wheeling a bicycle.</P>
<P>The woman of the house came out, and the young lady spoke to
her&mdash;the Lamb raised his hat as she passed him&mdash;and the children
could not hear what she said, though they were craning round the corner by
the pig&hyphen;pail and listening with all their ears. They felt it to be
&ldquo;perfectly fair,&rdquo; as Robert said, &ldquo;with that wretched
Lamb in that condition.&rdquo;</P>
<P>When the Lamb spoke, in a languid voice heavy with politeness, they
heard well enough.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A puncture?&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Can I not be of any
assistance? If you could allow me&mdash;?&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a stifled explosion of laughter behind the
pig&hyphen;pail&mdash;the grown&hyphen;up Lamb (otherwise Devereux) turned
the tail of an angry eye in its direction.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rdquo; said the lady, looking at the
Lamb. She looked rather shy, but, as
<PB ID="p244" N="244">
the boys put it, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any nonsense about her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But oh,&rdquo; whispered Cyril behind the pig&hyphen;pail,
&ldquo;I should have thought he&rsquo;d had enough bicycle&hyphen;mending
for one day&mdash; and if she only knew that really and truly he&rsquo;s
only a whiny&hyphen;piny, silly little baby!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <EMPH>not</EMPH>,&rdquo; Anthea murmured angrily.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dear&mdash;if people only let him alone. It&rsquo;s our
own precious Lamb still, whatever silly idiots may turn him
into&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he, Pussy?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane doubtfully supposed so.</P>
<P>Now, the Lamb&mdash;whom I must try to remember to call St.
Maur&mdash;was examining the lady&rsquo;s bicycle and talking to her with a
very grown&hyphen;up manner indeed. No one could possibly have supposed, to
see and hear him, that only that very morning he had been a chubby child of
two years breaking other people&rsquo;s Waterbury watches. Devereux (as he
ought to be called for the future) took out a gold watch when he had mended
the lady&rsquo;s bicycle, and all the onlookers behind the pig&hyphen;pail
said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;because it seemed
<PB ID="pf245">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five245"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p245" N="245">
so unfair that the Baby, who had only that morning destroyed two cheap but
honest watches, should now, in the grown&hyphen;upness Cyril&rsquo;s folly
had raised him to, have a real gold watch&mdash;with a chain and seals!</P>
<P>Hilary (as I will now term him) withered his brothers and sisters with a
glance, and then said to the lady&mdash;with whom he seemed to be quite
friendly&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you will allow me, I will ride with you as far as the Cross
Roads; it is getting late, and there are tramps about.&rdquo;</P>
<P>No one will ever know what answer the young lady intended to give to
this gallant offer, for, directly Anthea heard it made, she rushed out,
knocking against the pig&hyphen;pail, which overflowed in a turbid stream,
and caught the Lamb (I suppose I ought to say Hilary) by the arm. The
others followed, and in an instant the four dirty children were visible,
beyond disguise.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him,&rdquo; said Anthea to the lady, and she
spoke with intense earnestness; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not fit to go with
anyone!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go away, little girl!&rdquo; said St. Maur (as
<PB ID="p246" N="246">
we will now call him) in a terrible voice. &ldquo;Go home at
once!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d much better not have anything to do with him,&rdquo;
the now reckless Anthea went on. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know who he is.
He&rsquo;s something very different from what you think he is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the lady not unnaturally, while
Devereux (as I must term the grown&hyphen;up Lamb) tried vainly to push
Anthea away. The others backed her up, and she stood solid as a rock.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You just let him go with you,&rdquo; said Anthea,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll soon see what I mean! How would you like to suddenly
see a poor little helpless baby spinning along downhill beside you with its
feet up on a bicycle it had lost control of?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The lady had turned rather pale.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who are these very dirty children?&rdquo; she asked the
grown&hyphen;up Lamb (sometimes called St. Maur in these pages).</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he lied miserably.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, Lamb! how <EMPH>can</EMPH> you?&rdquo; cried
Jane,&mdash;&ldquo;when you know perfectly well you&rsquo;re our
<PB ID="p247" N="247">
own little baby brother that we&rsquo;re so fond of. We&rsquo;re his big
brothers and sisters,&rdquo; she explained, turning to the lady, who with
trembling hands was now turning her bicycle towards the gate, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ve got to take care of him. And we must get him home before
sunset, or I don&rsquo;t know whatever will become of us. You see,
he&rsquo;s sort of under a spell&mdash;enchanted&mdash;you know what I
mean!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Again and again the Lamb (Devereux, I mean) had tried to stop
Jane&rsquo;s eloquence, but Robert and Cyril held him, one by each leg, and
no proper explanation was possible. The lady rode hastily away, and
electrified her relatives at dinner by telling them of her escape from a
family of dangerous lunatics. &ldquo;The little girl&rsquo;s eyes were
simply those of a maniac. I can&rsquo;t think how she came to be at
large,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>When her bicycle had whizzed away down the road, Cyril spoke
gravely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hilary, old chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must have had a
sunstroke or something. And the things you&rsquo;ve been saying to that
lady! Why, if we were to tell you the things you&rsquo;ve said
<PB ID="p248" N="248">
when you are yourself again, say to&hyphen;morrow morning, you
wouldn&rsquo;t even understand them&mdash;let alone believe them! You trust
to me, old chap, and come home, now, and if you&rsquo;re not yourself in
the morning we&rsquo;ll ask the milkman to ask the doctor to
come.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The poor grown&hyphen;up Lamb (St. Maur was really one of his Christian
names) seemed now too bewildered to resist.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Since you seem all to be as mad as the whole worshipful company
of hatters,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;I suppose I <EMPH>had</EMPH>
better take you home. But you&rsquo;re not to suppose I shall pass this
over. I shall have something to say to you all to&hyphen;morrow
morning.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, you will, my Lamb,&rdquo; said Anthea under her breath,
&ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t be at all the sort of thing you think it&rsquo;s
going to be.&rdquo;</P>
<P>In her heart she could hear the pretty, soft little loving voice of the
baby Lamb&mdash;so different from the affected tones of the dreadful
grown&hyphen;up Lamb (one of whose names were Devereux)&mdash;saying,
&ldquo;Me love Panty&mdash;wants to come to own Panty.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get home, for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; she
<PB ID="p249" N="249">
said. &ldquo;You shall say whatever you like in the morning&mdash;if you
can,&rdquo; she added in a whisper.</P>
<P>It was a gloomy party that went home through the soft evening. During
Anthea&rsquo;s remarks Robert had again made play with the pin and the
bicycle tyre and the Lamb (whom they had to call St. Maur or Devereux or
Hilary) seemed really at last to have had his fill of
bicycle&hyphen;mending. So the machine was wheeled.</P>
<P>The sun was just on the point of setting when they arrived at the White
House. The four elder children would have liked to linger in the lane till
the complete sunsetting turned the grown&hyphen;up Lamb (whose Christian
names I will not further weary you by repeating) into their own dear
tiresome baby brother. But he, in his grow&hyphen;upness, insisted on going
on, and thus he was met in the front garden by Martha.</P>
<P>Now you remember that, as a special favour, the Psammead had arranged
that the servants in the house should never notice any change brought about
by the wishes of the children. Therefore Martha merely saw the usual
<PB ID="p250" N="250">
party, with the baby Lamb, about whom she had been desperately anxious all
the afternoon, trotting beside Anthea on fat baby legs, while the children,
of course, still saw the grown&hyphen;up Lamb (never mind what names he was
christened by), and Martha rushed at him and caught him in her arms,
exclaiming&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come to his own Martha, then&mdash;a precious poppet!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The grown&hyphen;up Lamb (whose names shall now be buried in oblivion)
struggled furiously. An expression of intense horror and annoyance was seen
on his face. But Martha was stronger than he. She lifted him up and carried
him into the house. None of the children will ever forget that picture. The
neat grey&hyphen;flannel&hyphen;suited grown&hyphen;up young man with the
green tie and the little black moustache&mdash;fortunately, he was slightly
built. and not tall&mdash;struggling in the sturdy arms of Martha, who bore
him away helpless, imploring him, as she went, to be a good boy now, and
come and have his nice bremmink! Fortunately, the sun set as they reached
the doorstep, the bicycle disappeared, and Martha was seen to carry into
the house
<PB ID="pf250">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-five250"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p251" N="251">
the real live darling sleepy two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Lamb. The
grown&hyphen;up Lamb (nameless henceforth) was gone for ever.</P>
<P>&ldquo;For ever,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;because, as soon as ever the
Lamb&rsquo;s old enough to be bullied, we must jolly well begin to bully
him, for his own sake&mdash;so that he mayn&rsquo;t grow up like
<EMPH>that</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t bully him,&rdquo; said Anthea
stoutly,&mdash;&ldquo;not if I can stop it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We must tame him by kindness,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;if he grows up in the usual
way, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of time to correct him as he goes along. The
awful thing to&hyphen;day was his growing up so suddenly. There was no time
to improve him at all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want any improving,&rdquo; said Anthea as the
voice of the Lamb came coming through the open door, just as she had heard
it in her heart that afternoon&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Me loves Panty&mdash;wants to come to own Panty!&rdquo;</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">SCALPS</HEAD>
<P><HI>PROBABLY</HI> the day would have been a greater success if Cyril had
not been reading <BIBL>The Last of the Mohicans</BIBL>. The story was
running in his head at breakfast, and as he took his third cup of tea he
said dreamily, &ldquo;I wish there were Red Indians in England&mdash;not
big ones, you know, but little ones, just about the right size for us to
fight.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Everyone disagreed with him at the time, and no one attached any
importance to the incident. But when they went down to the sand&hyphen;pit
to ask for a hundred pounds in two&hyphen;shilling pieces with Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s head on, to prevent mistakes&mdash;which they had always
felt to be a really reasonable wish that must turn out well&mdash;they
found out that they had done it again! For the Psammead, which was very
cross and sleepy, said&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p254" N="254">
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother me. You&rsquo;ve had your wish.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember yesterday?&rdquo; said the
Sand&hyphen;fairy, still more disagreeably. &ldquo;You asked me to let you
have your wishes wherever you happened to be, and you wished this morning,
and you&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, have we?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve forgotten?&rdquo; said the Psammead, beginning to
burrow. &ldquo;Never mind; you&rsquo;ll know soon enough. And I wish you
joy of it! A nice thing you&rsquo;ve let yourselves in for!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We always do, somehow,&rdquo; said Jane sadly.</P>
<P>And now the odd thing was that no one could remember anyone&rsquo;s
having wished for anything that morning. The wish about the Red Indians had
not stuck in anyone&rsquo;s head. It was a most anxious morning. Everyone
was trying to remember what had been wished for, and no one could, and
everyone kept expecting something awful to happen every minute. It was most
agitating; they knew, from what the Psammead had said, that they must have
wished for something more than usually undesirable, and they spent several
hours
<PB ID="p255" N="255">
in most agonising uncertainty. It was not till nearly dinner&hyphen;time
that Jane tumbled over <BIBL>The Last of the Mohicans</BIBL>,&mdash;which
had, of course, been left face downwards on the floor,&mdash;and when
Anthea had picked her and the book up she suddenly said, &ldquo;I
know!&rdquo; and sat down flat on the carpet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, Pussy, how awful! It was Indians he wished
for&mdash;Cyril&mdash;at breakfast, don&rsquo;t you remember? He said,
&lsquo;I wish there were Red Indians in England,&rsquo;&mdash;and now there
are, and they&rsquo;re going about scalping people all over the country, as
likely as not.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re only in Northumberland and Durham,&rdquo;
said Jane soothingly. It was almost impossible to believe that it could
really hurt people much to be scalped so far away as that.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it!&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;The
Sammyadd said we&rsquo;d let ourselves in for a nice thing. That means
they&rsquo;ll come <EMPH>here</EMPH>. And suppose they scalped the
Lamb!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Perhaps the scalping would come right again at sunset,&rdquo;
said Jane; but she did not speak so hopefully as usual.</P>
<PB ID="p256" N="256">
<P>&ldquo;Not it!&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;The things that grow out of
the wishes don&rsquo;t go. Look at the fifteen shillings! Pussy, I&rsquo;m
going to break something, and you must let me have every penny of money
you&rsquo;ve got. The Indians will come <EMPH>here</EMPH>, don&rsquo;t you
see? That spiteful Psammead as good as said so. You see what my plan is?
Come on!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane did not see at all. But she followed her sister meekly into their
mother&rsquo;s bedroom.</P>
<P>Anthea lifted down the heavy water&hyphen;jug&mdash;it had a pattern of
storks and long grasses on it, which Anthea never forgot. She carried it
into the dressing&hyphen;room, and carefully emptied the water out of it
into the bath. Then she took the jug back into the bedroom and dropped it
on the floor. You know how a jug always breaks if you happen to drop it by
accident. If you happen to drop it on purpose, it is quite different.
Anthea dropped that jug three times, and it was as unbroken as ever. So at
last she had to take her father&rsquo;s boot&hyphen;tree and break the jug
with that in cold blood. It was heartless work.</P>
<P>Next she broke open the missionary&hyphen;box
<PB ID="p257" N="257">
with the poker. Jane told her that it was wrong, of course, but Anthea shut
her lips very tight and then said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly&mdash;it&rsquo;s a matter of life and
death.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was not very much in the missionary&hyphen;box,&mdash;only
seven&hyphen;and&hyphen;fourpence,&mdash;but the girls between them had
nearly four shillings. This made over eleven shillings, as you will easily
see.</P>
<P>Anthea tied up the money in a corner of her pocket&hyphen;handkerchief.
&ldquo;Come on, Jane!&rdquo; she said, and ran down to the farm. She knew
that the farmer was going into Rochester that afternoon. In fact it had
been arranged that he was to take the four children with him. They had
planned this in the happy hour when they believed that they were going to
get that hundred pounds, in two&hyphen;shilling pieces, out of the
Psammead. They had arranged to pay the farmer two shillings each for the
ride. Now Anthea hastily explained to him that they could not go, but would
he take Martha and the Baby instead? He agreed, but he was not pleased to
get only half&hyphen;a&hyphen;crown instead of eight shillings.</P>
<PB ID="p258" N="258">
<P>Then the girls ran home again. Anthea was agitated, but not flurried.
When she came to think it over afterwards, she could not help seeing that
she had acted with the most far&hyphen;seeing promptitude, just like a born
general. She fetched a little box from her corner drawer, and went to find
Martha, who was laying the cloth and not in the best of tempers.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve broken the
toilet&hyphen;jug in mother&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Just like you&mdash;always up to some mischief,&rdquo; said
Martha, dumping down a salt&hyphen;cellar with a bang.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Martha dear,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got enough money to pay for a new one&mdash;if only
you&rsquo;ll be a dear and go and buy it for us. Your cousins keep a
china&hyphen;shop, don&rsquo;t they? And I would like you to get it
to&hyphen;day, in case mother comes home to&hyphen;morrow. You know she
said she might, perhaps.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re all going into town yourselves,&rdquo; said
Martha.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to, if we get the new jug,&rdquo; said
Anthea; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll pay for you to go,
<PB ID="p259" N="259">
if you&rsquo;ll take the Lamb. And I say Martha, look here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
give you my Liberty box, if you&rsquo;ll go. Look, it&rsquo;s most awfully
pretty&mdash;all inlaid with real silver and ivory and ebony like King
Solomon&rsquo;s temple.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Martha,&mdash;&ldquo;no, I don&rsquo;t want
your box, miss. What you want is to get the precious Lamb off your hands
for the afternoon. Don&rsquo;t you go for to think I don&rsquo;t see
through you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was so true that Anthea longed to deny it at once. Martha had no
business to know so much. But she held her tongue.</P>
<P>Martha set down the bread with a bang that made it jump off its
trencher.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I <EMPH>do</EMPH> want the jug got,&rdquo; said Anthea softly.
&ldquo;You <EMPH>will</EMPH> go, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, just for this once, I don&rsquo;t mind; but mind you
don&rsquo;t get into none of your outrageous mischief while I&rsquo;m
gone&mdash; that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going earlier than he thought,&rdquo; said Anthea
eagerly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hurry and get dressed. Do put on that
lovely purple frock, Martha, and the hat with the pink cornflowers, and the
yellow&hyphen;lace collar. Jane&rsquo;ll
<PB ID="p260" N="260">
finish laying the cloth, and I&rsquo;ll wash the Lamb and get him
ready.&rdquo;</P>
<P>As she washed the unwilling Lamb, and hurried him into his best clothes,
Anthea peeped out of the window from time to time; so far all was
well&mdash;she could see no Red Indians. When with a rush and a scurry and
some deepening of the damask of Martha&rsquo;s complexion she and the Lamb
had been got off, Anthea drew a deep breath.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>He&rsquo;s</EMPH> safe!&rdquo; she said, and, to
Jane&rsquo;s horror, flung herself down on the floor and burst into floods
of tears. Jane did not understand at all how a person could be so brave and
like a general, and then suddenly give way and go flat like an
air&hyphen;balloon when you prick it. It is better not to go flat, of
course, but you will observe that Anthea did not give way till her aim was
accomplished. She had got the dear Lamb out of danger&mdash;she felt
certain the Red Indians would be round the White House or nowhere&mdash;the
farmer&rsquo;s cart would not come back till after sunset, so she could
afford to cry a little. It was partly with joy that she cried, because she
had done what she
<PB ID="p261" N="261">
meant to do. She cried for about three minutes, while Jane hugged her
miserably and said at five&hyphen;second intervals, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,
Panther dear!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then she jumped up, rubbed her eyes hard with the corner of her
pinafore, so that they kept red for the rest of the day, and started to
tell the boys. But just at that moment cook rang the dinner&hyphen;bell,
and nothing could be said till they had all been helped to minced beef.
Then cook left the room, and Anthea told her tale. But it is a mistake to
tell a thrilling tale when people are eating minced beef and boiled
potatoes. There seemed somehow to be something about the food that made the
idea of Red Indians seem flat and unbelievable. The boys actually laughed,
and called Anthea a little silly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sure it was
before I said that that Jane said she wished it would be a fine
day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jane briefly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, if it was Indians,&rdquo; Cyril went on&mdash;&ldquo;salt,
please, and mustard&mdash;I must have something to make this mush go
down,&mdash;if it was Indians, they&rsquo;d have been infesting the
<PB ID="p262" N="262">
place long before this&mdash;you know they would. I believe it&rsquo;s the
fine day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then why did the Sammyadd say we&rsquo;d let ourselves in for a
nice thing?&rdquo; asked Anthea. She was feeling very cross. She knew she
had acted with nobility and discretion, and after that it was very hard to
be called a little silly, especially when she had the weight of a burglared
missionary&hyphen;box and about seven&hyphen;and&hyphen;fourpence, mostly
in coppers, lying like lead upon her conscience.</P>
<P>There was a silence, during which cook took away the mincy plates and
brought in the treacle&hyphen;pudding. As soon as she had retired, Cyril
began again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;that it wasn&rsquo;t a good thing to get Martha and the Lamb out of
the light for the afternoon; but as for Red Indians&mdash;why, you know
jolly well the wishes always come that very minute. If there was going to
be Red Indians, they&rsquo;d be here now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I expect they are,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
lurking amid the undergrowth, for anything you know. I do think
you&rsquo;re most beastly unkind.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p263" N="263">
<P>&ldquo;Indians almost always <EMPH>do</EMPH> lurk, really, though,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; put in Jane, anxious for peace.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cyril tartly. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m not unkind, I&rsquo;m only truthful. And I say it was utter rot
breaking the water&hyphen;jug; and as for the missionary&hyphen;box, I
believe it&rsquo;s a treason&hyphen;crime, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
you could be hanged for it, if any of us was to split&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shut up, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Robert; but Cyril
couldn&rsquo;t. You see, he felt in his heart that if there
<EMPH>should</EMPH> be Indians they would be entirely his own fault, so he
did not wish to believe in them. And trying not to believe things when in
your heart you are almost sure they are true, is as bad for the temper as
anything I know.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply idiotic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;talking about
Indians, when you can see for yourselves that it&rsquo;s Jane who&rsquo;s
got her wish. Look what a fine day it
is&mdash;<EMPH>OH!</EMPH>&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>He had turned towards the window to point out the fineness of the
day&mdash;the others turned too&mdash;and a frozen silence caught at Cyril,
and none of the others felt at all like breaking it.
<PB ID="p264" N="264">
For there, peering round the corner of the window, among the red leaves of
the Virginia creeper, was a face&mdash;a brown face, with a long nose and a
tight mouth and very bright eyes. And the face was painted in coloured
patches. It had long black hair, and in the hair were feathers!</P>
<P>Every child&rsquo;s mouth in the room opened, and stayed open. The
treacle&hyphen;pudding was growing white and cold on their plates. No one
could move.</P>
<P>Suddenly the feathered head was cautiously withdrawn, and the spell was
broken. I am sorry to say that Anthea&rsquo;s first words were very like a
girl.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There, now!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Treacle&hyphen;pudding had now definitely ceased to charm. Hastily
wrapping their portions in a <BIBL>Spectator</BIBL> of the week before the
week before last, they hid them behind the crinkled&hyphen;paper
stove&hyphen;ornament, and fled upstairs to reconnoitre, and to hold a
hurried council.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Pax,&rdquo; said Cyril handsomely when they reached their
mother&rsquo;s bedroom. &ldquo;Panther, I&rsquo;m sorry if I was a
brute.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p265" N="265">
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;but you see now!&rdquo;</P>
<P>No further trace of Indians, however, could be discerned from the
windows.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;what are we to do?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The only thing I can think of,&rdquo; said Anthea, who was now
generally admitted to be the heroine of the day, &ldquo;is&mdash;if we
dressed up as like Indians as we can, and looked out of the windows, or
even went out, they might think we were the powerful leaders of a large
neighbouring tribe, and&mdash;and not do anything to us, you know, for fear
of awful vengeance.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But Eliza, and the cook?&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You forget&mdash;they can&rsquo;t notice anything,&rdquo; said
Robert. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t notice anything out of the way, even if
they were scalped or roasted at a slow fire.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But would they come right at sunset?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course. You can&rsquo;t be really scalped or burned to death
without noticing it, and you&rsquo;d be sure to notice it next day, even if
it escaped your attention at the time,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I think
Anthea&rsquo;s right, but we shall want a most awful lot of
feathers.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p266" N="266">
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down to the hen&hyphen;house,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of the turkeys in there&mdash;it&rsquo;s not very
well. I could cut its feathers without it minding much. It&rsquo;s very
bad&mdash; doesn&rsquo;t seem to care what happens to it. Get me the
cutting&hyphen;out scissors.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Earnest reconnoitring convinced them all that no Indians were in the
poultry&hyphen;yard. Robert went. In five minutes he came back&mdash;pale,
but with many feathers.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is jolly serious. I cut
off the feathers, and when I turned to come out there was an Indian
squinting at me from under the old hen&hyphen;coop. I just brandished the
feathers and yelled, and got away before he could get the coop off the top
of himself. Panther, get the coloured blankets off our beds, and look
slippy, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It is wonderful how like an Indian you can make yourselves with blankets
and feathers and coloured scarves. Of course none of the children happened
to have long black hair, but there was a lot of black calico that had been
got to cover school&hyphen;books with. They
<PB ID="p267" N="267">
cut strips of this into a sort of fine fringe, and fastened it round their
heads with the amber&hyphen;coloured ribbons off the girls&rsquo; Sunday
dresses. Then they stuck turkeys&rsquo; feathers in the ribbons. The calico
looked very like long black hair, especially when the strips began to curl
up a bit.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But our faces,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not at
all the right colour. We&rsquo;re all rather pale, and I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t know why, but Cyril is the colour of putty.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The real Indians outside seem to be brownish,&rdquo; said Robert
hastily. &ldquo;I think we ought to be really
<EMPH>red</EMPH>&mdash;it&rsquo;s sort of superior to have a red skin, if
you are one.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The red ochre cook used for the kitchen bricks seemed to be about the
reddest thing in the house. The children mixed some in a saucer with milk,
as they had seen cook do for the kitchen floor. Then they carefully painted
each other&rsquo;s faces and hands with it, till they were quite as red as
any Red Indian need be&mdash;if not redder.</P>
<P>They knew at once that they must look
<PB ID="p268" N="268">
very terrible when they met Eliza in the passage, and she screamed aloud.
This unsolicited testimonial pleased them very much. Hastily telling her
not to be a goose, and that it was only a game, the four blanketed,
feathered, really and truly Redskins went boldly out to meet the foe, I say
boldly. That is because I wish to be polite.
At <SIC CORR="any rate">anyrate</SIC>, they went.</P>
<P>Along the hedge dividing the wilderness from the garden was a row of
dark heads, all highly feathered.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance,&rdquo; whispered Anthea. &ldquo;Much
better than to wait for their blood&hyphen;freezing attack. We must pretend
like mad. Like that game of cards where you pretend you&rsquo;ve got aces
when you haven&rsquo;t. Fluffing they call it, I think. Now then.
Whoop!&rdquo;</P>
<P>With four wild war&hyphen;whoops&mdash;or as near them as English
children could be expected to go without any previous practice&mdash;they
rushed through the gate and struck four warlike attitudes in the face of
the line of Red Indians. These were all about the same height, and that
height was Cyril&rsquo;s.</P>
<PB ID="p269" N="269">
<P>&ldquo;I hope to goodness they can talk English,&rdquo; said Cyril
through his attitude.</P>
<P>Anthea knew they could, though she never knew how she came to know it.
She had a white towel tied to a walking&hyphen;stick. This was a flag of
truce, and she waved it, in the hope that the Indians would know what it
was. Apparently they did&mdash;for one who was browner than the others
stepped forward.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ye seek a pow&hyphen;wow?&rdquo; he said in excellent English.
&ldquo;I am Golden Eagle, of the mighty tribe of
Rock&hyphen;dwellers.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Anthea, with a sudden inspiration, &ldquo;am
the Black Panther&mdash;chief of the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;Mazawattee
tribe. My brothers&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;yes, I do&mdash;the
tribe&mdash;I mean the Mazawattees&mdash;are in ambush below the brow of
yonder hill.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And what mighty warriors be these?&rdquo; asked Golden Eagle,
turning to the others.</P>
<P>Cyril said he was the great chief Squirrel, of the Moning Congo tribe,
and, seeing that Jane was sucking her thumb and could evidently think of no
name for herself, he
<PB ID="p270" N="270">
added, &ldquo;This great warrior is Wild Cat&mdash;Pussy Ferox we call it
in this land&mdash;leader of the vast Phiteezi tribe.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And thou, valorous Redskin?&rdquo; Golden Eagle inquired suddenly
of Robert, who, taken unawares, could only reply that he was Bobs, leader
of the Cape Mounted Police.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Black Panther, &ldquo;our tribes, if we just
whistle them up, will far outnumber your puny forces; so resistance is
useless. Return, therefore, to your own land, O brother, and smoke pipes of
peace in your wampums with your squaws and your medicine&hyphen;men, and
dress yourselves in the gayest wigwams, and eat happily of the juicy
fresh&hyphen;caught moccasins.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it all wrong,&rdquo; murmured Cyril angrily. But
Golden Eagle only looked inquiringly at her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thy customs are other than ours, O Black Panther,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Bring up thy tribe, that we may hold pow&hyphen;wow in state before
them, as becomes great chiefs.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring them up right enough,&rdquo; said
<PB ID="p271" N="271">
Anthea, &ldquo;with their bows and arrows, and tomahawks and
scalping&hyphen;knives, and everything you can think of, if you don&rsquo;t
look sharp and go.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She spoke bravely enough, but the hearts of all the children were
beating furiously, and their breath came in shorter and shorter gasps. For
the little real Red Indians were closing up round them&mdash;coming nearer
and nearer with angry murmurs&mdash;so that they were the centre of a crowd
of dark cruel faces.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no go,&rdquo; whispered Robert. &ldquo;I knew it
wouldn&rsquo;t be. We must make a bolt for the Psammead. It might help us.
If it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, I suppose we shall come alive again at
sunset. I wonder if scalping hurts as much as they say.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wave the flag again,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;If
they stand back, we&rsquo;ll run for it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She waved the towel, and the chief commanded his followers to stand
back. Then, charging wildly at the place where the line of Indians was
thinnest, the four children started to run. Their first rush knocked down
some half&hyphen;dozen Indians, over whose
<PB ID="p272" N="272">
blanketed bodies the children leaped, and made straight for the
sand&hyphen;pit. This was no time for the safe easy way by which carts go
down&mdash;right over the edge of the sand&hyphen;pit they went, among the
yellow and pale purple flowers and dried grasses, past the little
sand&hyphen;martins&rsquo; little front doors, skipping, clinging,
bounding, stumbling, sprawling, and finally rolling.</P>
<P>Yellow Eagle and his followers came up with them just at the very spot
where they had seen the Psammead that morning.</P>
<P>Breathless and beaten, the wretched children now awaited their fate.
Sharp knives and axes gleamed round them, but worse than these was the
cruel light in the eyes of Golden Eagle and his followers.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ye have lied to us, O Black Panther of the Mazawattees&mdash;and
thou, too, Squirrel of the Moning Congos. These also, Pussy Ferox of the
Phiteezi, and Bobs of the Cape Mounted Police,&mdash;these also have lied
to us, if not with their tongues, yet by their silence. Ye have lied under
the cover of the Truce&hyphen;flag of the Pale&hyphen;face. Ye have no
followers.
<PB ID="p273" N="273">
Your tribes are far away&mdash;following the hunting trail. What shall be
their doom?&rdquo; he concluded, turning with a bitter smile to the other
Red Indians.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Build we the fire!&rdquo; shouted his followers; and at once a
dozen ready volunteers started to look for fuel. The four children, each
held between two strong little Indians, cast despairing glances round them.
Oh, if they could only see the Psammead!</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you really mean to scalp us first and then roast us?&rdquo;
asked Anthea desperately.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Redskin opened his eyes at her.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always done.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Indians had formed a ring round the children, and now sat on the
ground gazing at their captives. There was a threatening silence.</P>
<P>Then slowly, by twos and threes, the Indians who had gone to look for
firewood came back, and they came back empty&hyphen;handed. They had not
been able to find a single stick of wood for a fire! No one ever can, as a
matter of fact, in that part of Kent.</P>
<P>The children drew a deep breath of relief,
<PB ID="p274" N="274">
but it ended in a moan of terror. For bright knives were being brandished
all about them. Next moment each child was seized by an Indian; each closed
its eyes and tried not to scream. They waited for the sharp agony of the
knife. It did not come. Next moment they were released, and fell in a
trembling heap. Their heads did not hurt at all. They only felt strangely
cool! Wild war&hyphen;whoops rang in their ears. When they ventured to open
their eyes they saw four of their foes dancing round them with wild leaps
and screams, and each of the four brandished in his hand a scalp of long
flowing black hair. They put their hands to their heads&mdash;their own
scalps were safe! The poor untutored savages had indeed scalped the
children. But they had only, so to speak, scalped them of the black calico
ringlets!</P>
<P>The children fell into each other&rsquo;s arms, sobbing and
laughing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Their scalps are ours,&rdquo; chanted the chief;
&ldquo;ill&hyphen;rooted were their ill&hyphen;fated hairs! They came off
in the hands of the victors&mdash;without struggle, without resistance,
they yielded their
<PB ID="p275" N="275">
scalps to the conquering Rock&hyphen;dwellers! Oh, how little a thing is a
scalp so lightly won!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take our real ones in a minute; you see if they
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Robert, trying to rub some of the red ochre off
his face and hands on to his hair.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Cheated of our just and fiery revenge are we,&rdquo; the chant
went on,&mdash;&ldquo;but there are other torments than the
scalping&hyphen;knife and the flames. Yet is the slow fire the correct
thing. O strange unnatural country, wherein a man may find no wood to burn
his enemy!&mdash;Ah, for the boundless forests of my native land, where the
great trees for thousands of miles grow but to furnish firewood wherewithal
to burn our foes. Ah, would we were but in our native forest one
more!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Suddenly, like a flash of lightning, the golden gravel shone all round
the four children instead of the dusky figures. For every single Indian had
vanished on the instant at their leader&rsquo;s word. The Psammead must
have been there all the time. And it had given the Indian chief his
wish.</P>
<P>*   *   *   *   *   *</P>
<PB ID="p276" N="276">
<P>Martha brought home a jug with a pattern of storks and long grasses on
it. Also she brought back all Anthea&rsquo;s money.</P>
<P>&ldquo;My cousin, she give me the jug for luck; she said it was an odd
one what the basin of had got smashed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, Martha, you are a dear!&rdquo; sighed Anthea, throwing her
arms round her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; giggled Martha, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better make the
most of me while you&rsquo;ve got me. I shall give your ma notice directly
minute she cames back.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, Martha, we haven&rsquo;t been so <EMPH>very</EMPH> horrid to
you, have we?&rdquo; asked Anthea, aghast.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t that, miss.&rdquo; Martha giggled more than
ever. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&hyphen;goin&rsquo; to be married. It&rsquo;s Beale
the gamekeeper. He&rsquo;s been a&hyphen;proposin&rsquo; to me off and on
ever since you come home from the clergyman&rsquo;s where you got locked up
on the church&hyphen;tower. And to&hyphen;day I said the word an&rsquo;
made him a happy man.&rdquo;</P>
<P>*   *   *   *   *   *</P>
<P>Anthea put the seven&hyphen;and&hyphen;fourpence back in the
missionary&hyphen;box, and pasted paper over
<PB ID="p277" N="277">
the place where the poker had broken it. She was very glad to be able to do
this, and she does not know to this day whether breaking open a
missionary&hyphen;box is or is not a hanging matter.</P>

<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI (AND LAST)</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE LAST WISH</HEAD>
<P><HI>OF</HI> course you, who see above that this is the eleventh (and
last) chapter, know very well that the day of which this chapter tells must
be the last on which Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane will have a chance of
getting anything out of the Psammead, or Sand&hyphen;fairy.</P>
<P>But the children themselves did not know this. They were full of rosy
visions, and, whereas on other days they had often found it extremely
difficult to think of anything really nice to wish for, their brains were
now full of the most beautiful and sensible ideas. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; as
Jane remarked afterwards, &ldquo;is always the way.&rdquo; Everyone was up
extra early that morning, and these plans were hopefully discussed in the
garden before breakfast. The old idea of one hundred pounds in modern
florins
<PB ID="p280" N="280">
was still first favourite, but there were others that ran it
close&mdash;the chief of these being the &ldquo;pony each&rdquo; idea. This
had a great advantage. You could wish for a pony each during the morning,
ride it all day, have it vanish at sunset and wish it back again next day.
Which would be an economy of litter and stabling. But at breakfast two
things happened. First, there was a letter from mother. Granny was better,
and mother and father hoped to be home that very afternoon. A cheer arose.
And of course this news at once scattered all the before&hyphen;breakfast
wish&hyphen;ideas. For everyone saw quite plainly that the wish of the day
must be something to please mother and not to please themselves.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wonder what she <EMPH>would</EMPH> like,&rdquo; pondered
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d like us all to be good,&rdquo; said Jane primly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but that&rsquo;s so dull for us,&rdquo; Cyril rejoined;
&ldquo;and, besides, I should hope we could be that without
sand&hyphen;fairies to help us. No; it must be something splendid, that we
couldn&rsquo;t possibly get without wishing for.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; said Anthea in a warning voice;
<PB ID="p281" N="281">
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget yesterday. Remember, we get our wishes now just
wherever we happen to be when we say &lsquo;I wish.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s let ourselves in for anything silly&mdash;to&hyphen;day of all
days.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
jaw.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Just then Martha came in with a jug full of hot water for the
teapot&mdash;and a face full of importance for the children.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A blessing we&rsquo;re all alive to eat our breakfasses!&rdquo;
she said darkly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, whatever&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; everybody asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;only it seems
nobody&rsquo;s safe from being murdered in their beds nowadays.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Jane as an agreeable thrill of horror ran down
her back and legs and out at her toes, &ldquo;<EMPH>has</EMPH> anyone been
murdered in their beds?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; said Martha; &ldquo;but they might
just as well. There&rsquo;s been burglars over at Peasmarsh
Place&mdash;Beale&rsquo;s just told me&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve took every
single one of Lady Chittenden&rsquo;s diamonds and jewels and things, and
she&rsquo;s a&hyphen;goin&rsquo; out of one fainting fit into another,
<PB ID="p282" N="282">
with hardly time to say &lsquo;Oh, my diamonds!&rsquo; in between. And Lord
Chittenden&rsquo;s away in London.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Lady Chittenden,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve seen her.
She wears a red&hyphen;and&hyphen;white dress, and she has no children of
her own and can&rsquo;t abide other folkses&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her,&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s
put all her trust in riches, and you see how she&rsquo;s served. They say
the diamonds and things was worth thousands of thousands of pounds. There
was a necklace and a river&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;and no end of
bracelets; and a tarrer and ever so many rings. But there, I mustn&rsquo;t
stand talking and all the place to clean down afore your ma comes
home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she should ever have had such a lot of
diamonds,&rdquo; said Anthea when Martha had flounced off. &ldquo;She was
rather a nasty lady, I thought. And mother hasn&rsquo;t any diamonds, and
hardly any jewels&mdash;the topaz necklace, and the sapphire ring daddy
gave her when they were engaged, and the garnet star, and the little pearl
brooch with great&hyphen;grandpapa&rsquo;s hair in it,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
about all.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p283" N="283">
<P>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m grown up I&rsquo;ll buy mother no end of
diamonds,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;if she wants them. I shall make so
much money exploring Africa I shan&rsquo;t know what to do with
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be jolly,&rdquo; said Jane dreamily, &ldquo;if
mother could find all those lovely things, necklaces and rivers of diamonds
and tarrers?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Ti&hyphen;aras</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ti&hyphen;aras, then&mdash;and rings and everything in her room
when she came home? I wish she would.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others gazed at her in horror.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, she <EMPH>will</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve wished, my good Jane&mdash;and our only chance now is
to find the Psammead, and if it&rsquo;s in a good temper it
<EMPH>may</EMPH> take back the wish and give us another. If
not&mdash;well&mdash;goodness knows what we&rsquo;re in for!&mdash;the
police, of course, and&mdash;Don&rsquo;t cry, silly! We&rsquo;ll stand by
you. Father says we need never be afraid if we don&rsquo;t do anything
wrong and always speak the truth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But Cyril and Anthea exchanged gloomy glances. They remembered how
convincing
<PB ID="p284" N="284">
the truth about the Psammead had been once before when told to the
police.</P>
<P>It was a day of misfortunes. Of course the Psammead could not be found.
Nor the jewels, though every one of the children searched their
mother&rsquo;s room again and again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Robert said, &ldquo;<EMPH>we</EMPH>
couldn&rsquo;t find them. It&rsquo;ll be mother who&rsquo;ll do that.
Perhaps she&rsquo;ll think they&rsquo;ve been in the house for years and
years, and never know they are stolen ones at all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; Cyril was very scornful; &ldquo;then mother will
be a receiver of stolen goods, and you know jolly well what
<EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> worse than.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Another and exhaustive search of the sand&hyphen;pit failed to reveal
the Psammead, so the children went back to the house slowly and sadly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Anthea stoutly,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll tell mother the truth, and she&rsquo;ll give back the
jewels&mdash;and make everything all right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Cyril slowly. &ldquo;Do you think
she&rsquo;ll believe us? Could anyone believe about a Sammyadd unless
they&rsquo;d seen it? She&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re pretending.
<PB ID="p285" N="285">
Or else she&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re raving mad, and then we shall be
sent to Bedlam. How would you like it?&rdquo;&mdash;he turned suddenly on
the miserable Jane,&mdash;&ldquo;how would you like it, to be shut up in an
iron cage with bars and padded walls, and nothing to do but stick straws in
your hair all day, and listen to the howling and ravings of the other
maniacs? Make up your minds to it, all of you. It&rsquo;s no use telling
mother.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course it is, but it&rsquo;s not true enough for
grown&hyphen;up people to believe it,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;Cyril&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s put flowers in all the vases, and
try not to think about diamonds. After all, everything has come right in
the end all the other times.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they filled all the pots they could find with flowers&mdash;asters
and zinnias, and loose&hyphen;leaved late red roses from the wall of the
stable&hyphen;yard, till the house was a perfect bower.</P>
<P>And almost as soon as dinner was cleared away mother arrived, and was
clasped in eight loving arms. It was very difficult indeed not to tell her
all about the Psammead at once, because they had got into the habit of
telling
<PB ID="p286" N="286">
her everything. But they did succeed in not telling her.</P>
<P>Mother on her side, had plenty of tell them&mdash;about Granny and
Granny&rsquo;s pigeons, and Auntie Emma&rsquo;s lame tame donkey. She was
very delighted with the flowery&hyphen;boweryness of the house; and
everything seemed so natural and pleasant, now that she was home again,
that the children almost thought they must have dreamed the Psammead.</P>
<P>But, when Mother moved towards the stairs to go up to her bedroom and
take off her bonnet, the eight arms clung round her just as if she only had
two children, one the Lamb and the other an octopus.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go up, mummy darling,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;let
me take your things up for you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or I will,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We want you to come and look at the rose&hyphen;tree,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go up!&rdquo; said Jane helplessly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nonsense, dears,&rdquo; said mother briskly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
such an old woman yet that I can&rsquo;t take my bonnet off in the proper
place. Besides, I must wash these black hands of mine.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="pp287" N="287">
<P>So up she went, and the children, following her, exchanged glances of
gloomy foreboding.</P>
<P>Mother took off her bonnet&mdash;it was a very pretty hat, really, with
white roses in it,&mdash;and when she had taken it off she went to the
dressing&hyphen;table to do her pretty hair.</P>
<P>On the table between the ring&hyphen;stand and the pin&hyphen;cushion
lay a green leather case. Mother opened it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely!&rdquo; she cried. It was a ring, a large pearl
with shining many&hyphen;lighted diamonds set round it. &ldquo;Wherever did
this come from?&rdquo; mother asked, trying it on her wedding finger, which
it fitted beautifully. &ldquo;However did it come here?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said each of the children
truthfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Father must have told Martha to put it here,&rdquo; mother said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down and ask her.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let me look at it,&rdquo; said Anthea, who knew Martha would not
be able to see the ring. But when Martha was asked, of course she denied
putting the ring there, and so did Eliza and cook.</P>
<PB ID="p288" N="288">
<P>Mother came back to her bedroom, very much interested and pleased about
the ring. But, when she opened the dressing&hyphen;table drawer and found a
long case containing an almost priceless diamond necklace, she was more
interested still, though not so pleased. In the wardrobe, when she went to
put away her &ldquo;bonnet,&rdquo; she found a tiara and several brooches,
and the rest of the jewellery turned up in various parts of the room during
the next half&hyphen;hour. The children looked more and more uncomfortable,
and now Jane began to sniff.</P>
<P>Mother looked at her gravely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am sure you know something about
this. Now think before you speak, and tell me the truth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We found a Fairy,&rdquo; said Jane obediently.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No nonsense, please,&rdquo; said her mother sharply.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Jane,&rdquo; Cyril interrupted. Then he
went on desperately. &ldquo;Look here, mother, we&rsquo;ve never seen the
things before, but Lady Chittenden at Peasmarsh Place
<PB ID="p289" N="289">
lost all her jewellery by wicked burglars last night. Could this possibly
be it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>All drew a deep breath. They were saved.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But how could they have put it here? And why should they?&rdquo;
asked mother, not unreasonably. &ldquo;Surely it would have been easier and
safer to make off with it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;they thought it better to wait
for&mdash;for sunset&mdash;nightfall, I mean, before they went off with it.
No one but us knew that you were coming back to&hyphen;day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I must send for the police at once,&rdquo; said mother
distractedly. &ldquo;Oh, how I wish daddy were here!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to wait till he <EMPH>does</EMPH>
come?&rdquo; asked Robert, knowing that his father would not come home
before sunset.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no; I can&rsquo;t wait a minute with all this on my
mind,&rdquo; cried mother. &ldquo;All this&rdquo; was the heap of
jewel&hyphen;cases on the bed. They put them all in the wardrobe, and
mother locked it. Then mother called Martha.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has any stranger been into my
room since I&rsquo;ve been away? Now, answer me truthfully.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p290" N="290">
<P>&ldquo;No, mum,&rdquo; answered Martha; &ldquo;leastways, what I mean to
say&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
<P>She stopped.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said her mistress kindly; &ldquo;I see someone has.
You must tell me at once. Don&rsquo;t be frightened. I&rsquo;m sure you
haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Martha burst into heavy sobs.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I was a&hyphen;goin&rsquo; to give you warning this very day,
mum, to leave at the end of my month, so I was,&mdash;on account of me
being going to make a respectable young man happy. A gamekeeper he is by
trade, mum&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t deceive you&mdash;of the name of
Beale. And it&rsquo;s as true as I stand here, it was your coming home in
such a hurry, and no warning given, out of the kindness of his heart it
was, as he says, &lsquo;Martha, my beauty,&rsquo; he says,&mdash;which I
ain&rsquo;t, and never was, but you know how them men will go
on,&mdash;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see you a&hyphen;toiling and
a&hyphen;moiling and not lend a &rsquo;elping &rsquo;and; which mine is a
strong arm and it&rsquo;s yours, Martha, my dear,&rsquo; says he. And so he
helped me a&hyphen;cleanin&rsquo; of the windows&mdash;but outside, mum,
the whole time,
<PB ID="p291" N="291">
and me in; if I never say another breathing word it&rsquo;s the gospel
truth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Were you with him the whole time?&rdquo; asked her mistress.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Him outside me in, I was,&rdquo; said Martha; &ldquo;except for
fetching up a fresh pail and the leather that that slut of a Eliza&rsquo;d
hidden away behind the mangle.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the children&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;I
am not pleased with you, Martha, but you have spoken the truth, and that
counts for something.&rdquo;</P>
<P>When Martha had gone, the children clung round their mother.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, mummy darling,&rdquo; cried Anthea, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
Beale&rsquo;s fault, it isn&rsquo;t really! He&rsquo;s a great dear; he is,
truly and honourably, and as honest as the day. Don&rsquo;t let the police
taken him, mummy! oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was truly awful. Here was an innocent man accused of robbery through
that silly wish of Jane&rsquo;s, and it was absolutely useless to tell the
truth. All longed to, but they thought of the straws in the hair and the
shrieks of the
<PB ID="p292" N="292">
other frantic maniacs, and they could not do it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is there a cart hereabouts?&rdquo; asked mother feverishly.
&ldquo;A trap of any sort? I must drive in to Rochester and tell the police
at once.&rdquo;</P>
<P>All the children sobbed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cart at the farm, but,
oh, don&rsquo;t go!&mdash;don&rsquo;t go!&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t
go!&mdash;wait until daddy comes home!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Mother took not the faintest notice. When she had set her mind on a
thing she always went straight through with it; she was rather like Anthea
in this respect.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here, Cyril,&rdquo; she said, sticking on her hat with long
sharp violet&hyphen;headed pins, &ldquo;I leave you in charge. Stay in the
dressing&hyphen;room. You can pretend to be swimming boats in the bath, or
something. Say I give you leave. But stay here, with the landing door open;
I&rsquo;ve locked the other. And don&rsquo;t let anyone go into my room.
Remember, no one knows the jewels are there except me, and all of you, and
the wicked thieves who put them there. Robert, you stay in the garden and
watch the windows.
<PB ID="p293" N="293">
If anyone tries to get in you must run and tell the two farm men that
I&rsquo;ll send up to wait in the kitchen. I&rsquo;ll tell them there are
dangerous characters about&mdash;that&rsquo;s true enough. Now, remember, I
trust you both. But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll try it till after
dark, so you&rsquo;re quite safe. Good&hyphen;bye, darlings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And she locked her bedroom door and went off with the key in her
pocket.</P>
<P>The children could not help admiring the dashing and decided way in
which she had acted. They thought how useful she would have been in
organising escape from some of the tight places in which they had found
themselves of late in consequence of their ill&hyphen;timed wishes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a born general,&rdquo; said Cyril,&mdash;&ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen to us. Even if the girls were
to hunt for that beastly Sammyadd and find it, and get it to take the
jewels away again, mother would only think we hadn&rsquo;t looked out
properly and let the burglars sneak in and nick them&mdash;or else the
police will think <EMPH>we&rsquo;ve</EMPH> got them&mdash;or else that
she&rsquo;s been fooling them. Oh, it&rsquo;s a pretty
<PB ID="p294" N="294">
decent average ghastly mess this time, and no mistake!&rdquo;</P>
<P>He savagely made a paper boat and began to float it in the bath, as he
had been told to do.</P>
<P>Robert went into the garden and sat down on the worn yellow grass, with
his miserable head between his helpless hands.</P>
<P>Anthea and Jane whispered together in the passage downstairs, where the
cocoanut matting was&mdash;with the hole in it that you always caught your
foot in if you were not careful. Martha&rsquo;s voice could be heard in the
kitchen,&mdash;grumbling loud and long.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply too dreadfully awful,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;How do you know all the diamonds are there, too? If they
aren&rsquo;t the police will think mother and father have got them, and
that they&rsquo;ve only given up some of them for a kind of desperate
blind. And they&rsquo;ll be put in prison, and we shall be branded
outcasts, the children of felons. And it won&rsquo;t be at all nice for
father and mother either,&rdquo; she added, by a candid afterthought.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what can we <EMPH>do</EMPH>?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<PB ID="p295" N="295">
<P>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;at least we might look for the Psammead again.
It&rsquo;s a very, <EMPH>very</EMPH> hot day. He may have come out to warm
that whisker of his.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t give us any more beastly wishes
to&hyphen;day,&rdquo; said Jane flatly. &ldquo;He gets crosser and crosser
every time we see him. I believe he hates having to give wishes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea had been shaking her head gloomily&mdash;now she stopped shaking
it so suddenly that it really looked as though she were pricking up her
ears.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Jane. &ldquo;Oh, have you thought of
something?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Our one chance,&rdquo; cried Anthea dramatically; &ldquo;the last
lone&hyphen;lorn forlorn hope. Come on.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At a brisk trot she led the way to the sand&hyphen;pit.</P>
<P>Oh, joy!&mdash;there was the Psammead, basking in a golden sandy hollow
and preening its whiskers happily in the glowing afternoon sun. The moment
it saw them it whisked round and began to burrow&mdash;it evidently
preferred its own company to theirs. But Anthea was too quick for it. She
caught it by its furry shoulders gently but firmly, and held it.</P>
<PB ID="p296" N="296">
<P>&ldquo;Here&mdash;none of that!&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;Leave
go of me, will you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>But Anthea held him fast.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dear kind darling Sammyadd,&rdquo; she said breathlessly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;you
want another wish, I expect. But I can&rsquo;t keep on slaving from morning
till night giving people their wishes. I must have <EMPH>some</EMPH> time
to myself.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you hate giving wishes?&rdquo; asked Anthea gently, and her
voice trembled with excitement.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Leave go of me or
I&rsquo;ll bite!&mdash;I really will&mdash;I mean it. Oh, well, if you
chose to risk it.&rdquo; Anthea risked it and held on.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bite
me&mdash;listen to reason. If you&rsquo;ll only do what we want
to&hyphen;day, we&rsquo;ll never ask you for another wish as long as we
live.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead was much moved.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything,&rdquo; it said in a tearful voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost burst myself to give you one wish after another, as
long as I held out, if you&rsquo;d
<PB ID="p297" N="297">
only never, never ask me to do it after to&hyphen;day. If you knew how I
hate to blow myself out with other people&rsquo;s wishes, and how
frightened I am always that I shall strain a muscle or something. And then
to wake up every morning and know you&rsquo;ve <EMPH>got</EMPH> to do it.
You don&rsquo;t know what it is&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what it is, you
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Its voice cracked with emotion, and the last
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; was a squeak.</P>
<P>Anthea set it down gently on the sand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now,&rdquo; she said soothingly. &ldquo;We
promise faithfully never to ask for another wish after
to&hyphen;day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, go ahead,&rdquo; said the Psammead; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get
it over.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How many can you do?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;as long as I can hold out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, first, I wish Lady Chittenden may find she&rsquo;s never
lost her jewels.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead blew itself out, collapsed, and said,
&ldquo;Done.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Anthea more slowly, &ldquo;mother
mayn&rsquo;t get to the police.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the creature after the proper interval.</P>
<PB ID="p298" N="298">
<P>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Jane suddenly, &ldquo;mother could forget all
about the diamonds.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the Psammead; but its voice was weaker.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to rest a little?&rdquo; asked Anthea
considerately.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; said the Psammead; &ldquo;and before we go
any further, will you wish something for me?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do wishes for yourself?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;we were always expected to
give each other our wishes&mdash;not that we had any to speak of in the
good old Megatherium days. Just wish, will you, that you may never be able,
any of you, to tell anyone a word about <EMPH>Me</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see, if you told grown&hyphen;ups I should
have no peace of my life. They&rsquo;d get hold of me, and they
wouldn&rsquo;t wish silly things like you do, but real earnest things; and
the scientific people would hit on some way of making things last after
sunset, as likely as not; and they&rsquo;d ask for a graduated
income&hyphen;tax, and old&hyphen;age pensions and manhood suffrage, and 
<PB ID="p299" N="299">
free secondary education, and dull things like that; and get them, and keep
them, and the whole world would be turned topsy&hyphen;turvy. Do wish it!
Quick!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea repeated the Psammead&rsquo;s wish, and it blew itself out to a
larger size than they had yet seen it attain.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; it said as it collapsed, &ldquo;can I do anything
more for you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Just one thing; and I think that clears everything up,
doesn&rsquo;t it Jane? I wish Martha to forget about the diamond ring, and
mother to forget about the keeper cleaning the windows.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the &lsquo;Brass Bottle&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m glad we read that or I should never have thought
of it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Psammead faintly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost
worn out. Is there anything else?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No; only thank you kindly for all you&rsquo;ve done for us, and I
hope you&rsquo;ll have a good long sleep, and I hope we shall see you again
some day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It that a wish?&rdquo; it said in a weak voice.</P>
<PB ID="p300" N="300">
<P>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; said the two girls together.</P>
<P>Then for the last time in this story they saw the Psammead blow itself
out and collapse suddenly. It nodded to them, blinked its long
snail&rsquo;s eyes, burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the
last, and the sand closed over it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ve done right?&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we have,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Come on home
and tell the boys.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea found Cyril glooming over his paper boats, and told him. Jane
found Robert. The two tales were only just ended when mother walked in, hot
and dusty. She explained that as she was being driven into Rochester to buy
the girls&rsquo; autumn school&hyphen;dresses the axle had broken, and but
for the narrowness of the lane and the high soft hedges she would have been
thrown out. As it was, she was not hurt, but she had had to walk home.
&ldquo;And oh, my dearest dear chicks,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am simply
dying for a cup of tea! Do run and see if the kettle boils!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;So you see it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Jane whispered.
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p301" N="301">
<P>&ldquo;No more does Martha,&rdquo; said Anthea, who had been to ask
after the state of the kettle.</P>
<P>As the servants sat at their tea, Beale the gamekeeper dropped in. He
brought the welcome news that Lady Chittenden&rsquo;s diamonds had not been
lost at all. Lord Chittenden had taken them to be re&hyphen;set and
cleaned, and the maid who knew about it had gone for a holiday. So that was
all right.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wonder if we ever shall see the Psammead again,&rdquo; said
Jane wistfully as they walked in the garden, while mother was putting the
Lamb to bed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we shall,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;if you really
wished it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve promised never to ask it for another wish,&rdquo;
said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I never want to,&rdquo; said Robert earnestly.</P>
<P>They did see it again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not
in a sand&hyphen;pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It
was in a&mdash;But I must say no more.</P>
