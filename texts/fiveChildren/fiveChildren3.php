<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
BEING WANTED</h2>
<p><strong>THE</strong> morning after the children had been in possession of
boundless wealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or
enjoyable with it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an
imitation crocodile&ndash;skin purse, and a ride in a pony&ndash;cart,
they awoke without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on
the previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a
Psammead, or Sand&ndash;fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a
new wish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and
neither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange things,
even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing than those
times when nothing happens but meals,
and they are not always completely pleasant, especially on the days when it
is cold mutton or hash.</p>
<p>There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because
everyone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and
determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p59" name="59">
<p>for breakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the
question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very difficult
to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend faithfully to
your baby brother&rsquo;s breakfast needs. The Baby was particularly lively
that morning. He not only wriggled his body through the bar of his high
chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but he collared a
tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on the head with
it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He put his fat fist
in his bread&ndash;and&ndash;milk, and demanded &ldquo;nam,&rdquo; which
was only allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table&mdash;he
clamoured to &ldquo;go walky&rdquo;. The conversation was something like
this&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;about that Sandy&ndash;fairy&mdash;Look
out!&mdash;he&rsquo;ll have the milk over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milk removed to a safe distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;about that Fairy&mdash; No, Lamb dear, give Panther the
narky poon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Cyril tried. &ldquo;Nothing we&rsquo;ve had yet has turned
out&mdash;He nearly had the mustard that time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether we&rsquo;d better
wish&mdash;Hullo!&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it now, my boy!&rdquo; And, in a
flash of glass and pink baby&ndash;paws, the bowl of golden carp in the
middle of the</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p60" name="60">
<p>table rolled on its side and poured a flood of mixed water
and goldfish into the Baby&rsquo;s lap and into the laps of the others.</p>
<p>Everyone was almost as much upset as the goldfish; the Lamb only
remaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the
leaping, gasping goldfish had been collected and put back in the water, the
Baby was taken away to be entirely re&ndash;dressed by Martha, and most of
the others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had
been bathed in gold&ndash;fish&ndash;and&ndash;water were hung out to
dry, and then it turned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day before or appear all
day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft and frilly, and trimmed
with lace, and very. very pretty, quite as pretty as a frock, if not more
so. Only it was <em>not</em> a frock, and Martha&rsquo;s word was law.
She wouldn&rsquo;t let Jane wear her best frock, and she refused to listen
for a moment to Robert&rsquo;s suggestion that Jane should wear her best
petticoat and call it a dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not respectable,&rdquo; she said. And when people say
that, it&rsquo;s no use anyone&rsquo;s saying anything. You will find this
out for yourselves some day.</p>
<p>So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had
been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High
Street of Rochester,</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p61" name="61">
<p>just where a water&ndash;cart had passed on its
silvery way. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than
grazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to the
knees and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as to
abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on
the grass&ndash;plot round the sundial, and Jane darned away for dear
life. The Lamb was still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed,
so conversation was possible.</p>
<p>Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which
was that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak out&mdash;say what you&rsquo;ve got to say&mdash;I hate
hinting, and &lsquo;don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; and sneakish ways like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So then Robert said, as in honour bound: &ldquo;Sneak
yourself&mdash;Anthea and me weren&rsquo;t so goldfishy as you two were, so
we got changed quicker, and we&rsquo;ve had time to think it over, and if
you ask me&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you,&rdquo; said Jane, biting off a needleful
of thread as she had always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you
don&rsquo;t know that if you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they
wind tight round your heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she
told me also about the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to
believe&mdash;what with nurses and science?)</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p62" name="62">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who asks or who doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Robert, &ldquo;but Anthea and I think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If
it can give us our wishes I suppose it can give itself its own, and I feel
almost sure it wishes every time that our wishes shan&rsquo;t do us any
good. Let&rsquo;s let the tiresome beast alone, and just go and have a
jolly good game of forts, on our own, in the chalk&ndash;pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(You will remember that the happily&ndash;situated house where these
children were spending their holidays lay between a chalk&ndash;quarry and
a gravel&ndash;pit.)</p>
<p>Cyril and Jane were more hopeful&mdash;they generally were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Sammyadd does it on purpose,&rdquo; Cyril
said; &ldquo;and, after all, it <em>was</em> silly to wish for
boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in two&ndash;shilling pieces would have
been much more sensible. And wishing to be beautiful as the day was simply
donkeyish. I don&rsquo;t want to be disagreeable, but it <em>was</em>.
We must try to find a really useful wish, and wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane dropped her work and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too, it&rsquo;s too silly to have a chance like this
and not use it. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a
chance; there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that
wouldn&rsquo;t turn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do
let&rsquo;s think hard,</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p63" name="63">
<p>and wish something nice, so that we can have a real
jolly day&mdash;what there is left of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and
everyone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not
possibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were used
to talking &ldquo;by fours,&rdquo; as soldiers march, and each of them
could say what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable
sound of its own voice, and at the same time have three&ndash;quarters of
two sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an
easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay you
can&rsquo;t do even that, I won&rsquo;t ask you to tell me whether &frac34;
&times; 2 = 1 &frac12;, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the
amount of ear each child was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in Roman times, as
we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too instructive.</p>
<p>When the frock was darned, the start for the gravel&ndash;pit was
delayed by Martha&rsquo;s insisting on everybody&rsquo;s washing its
hands&mdash;which was nonsense, because nobody had been doing anything at
all, except Jane, and how can you get dirty doing nothing? That is a
difficult question, and I cannot answer it on paper. In real life I could
very soon show you&mdash;or you me, which is much more likely.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p64" name="64">
<p>During the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four
children, so <em>that</em> sum comes right), it had been decided that
fifty pounds in two&ndash;shilling pieces was the right wish to have. And
the lucky children, who could have anything in the wide world by just
wishing for it, hurriedly started for the gravel&ndash;pit to express
their wishes to the Psammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted
on their taking the Baby with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not want him indeed! Why, everybody &rsquo;ud want him, a duck!
with all their hearts
they would; and you know you promised your ma to take him out every blessed
day,&rdquo; said Martha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we did,&rdquo; said Robert in gloom, &ldquo;but I wish the
Lamb wasn&rsquo;t quite so young and small. It would be much better fun
taking him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll mend of his youngness with time,&rdquo; said Martha;
&ldquo;and as for his smallness, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d fancy
carrying of him any more, however big he was. Besides he can walk a bit,
bless his precious fat legs, a ducky! He feels the benefit of the
new&ndash;laid air, so he does, a pet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea&rsquo;s arms, and
went back to make new pinafores on the sewing&ndash;machine. She was a
rapid performer on this instrument.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p65" name="65">
<p>The Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, &ldquo;Walky wif Panty,&rdquo;
and rode on Robert&rsquo;s back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane
with stones, and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could
long be sorry that he was of the party.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a week&rsquo;s wishes to assuring the Baby&rsquo;s future, by asking such gifts for him as the good fairies give to Infant
Princes in proper fairy&ndash;tales, but Anthea soberly reminded her that
as the Sand&ndash;fairy&rsquo;s wishes only lasted till sunset they could
not ensure any benefit to the Baby&rsquo;s later years; and Jane owned that
it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in two&ndash;shilling pieces,
and buy the Lamb a three&ndash;pound fifteen rocking&ndash;horse, like
those in the Army and Navy Stores list, with part of the money.</p>
<p>It was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got
it, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again, taking
Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And they would
make a list of the things they really wanted before they started. Full of
high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe slow
cart&ndash;road to the gravel&ndash;pits, and as they went in between the
mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned their
ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a</p>

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p66" name="66">
<p>book. Being real live 
children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather blank
and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday, when they
had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was getting ready to
fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright guineas&mdash;millions of
them&mdash;it had told the children to run along outside the quarry for
fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid treasure. And they
had run. And so it happened that they had not had time to mark the spot
where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as before. And it was this
thought that put such silly expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the hopeful Jane, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and
they looked, and though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could they
find the Sand&ndash;fairy.</p>
<p>At last they had to sit down and rest&mdash;not at all because they were
weary or disheartened of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being put
down, and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have happened to lose in the
sand if you have an active baby to look after at the same time. Get someone
to drop your best knife in the sand next time you go to the seaside, and
then take your baby brother with you when you go to look for it, and you
will see that I am right.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p67" name="67">
<p>The Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country
air, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go on
talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found the
Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself.</p>
<p>He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into
Anthea&rsquo;s face, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand
and waved his fat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his
eyes, as it had into Anthea&rsquo;s, and he howled.</p>
<p>The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of
ginger&ndash;beer with him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed
him. This had to be uncorked hurriedly&mdash;it was the only
wet thing within reach, and it was necessary to wash the sand out of the
Lamb&rsquo;s eyes somehow. Of course the ginger hurt horribly, and he
howled more than ever. And, amid his anguish of kicking, the bottle was
upset and the beautiful ginger&ndash;beer frothed out into the sand and
was lost for ever.</p>
<p>It was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot
himself as to say&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p68" name="68">
<p>&ldquo;Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don&rsquo;t; Martha
doesn&rsquo;t, not really, or she&rsquo;d jolly well keep him with her.
He&rsquo;s a little nuisance, that&rsquo;s what he is. It&rsquo;s too bad.
I only wish everybody <em>did</em> want him with all their hearts; we
might get some peace in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that
there is only one safe way of taking things out of little children&rsquo;s
eyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you
love the Baby as much as you ought to.</p>
<p>Then there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for
having been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either.
You often notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it
ought not to&mdash;and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one
who oughtn&rsquo;t to have said it is sorry.</p>
<p>The silence was broken by a sigh&mdash;a breath suddenly let out. The
children&rsquo;s heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each
nose, and someone had pulled all the strings at once.</p>
<p>And everyone saw the Sand&ndash;fairy sitting quite close to them, with
the expression which it used as a smile on its hairy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&ndash;morning,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;I did that quite
easily! Everyone wants him now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p69" name="69">
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Robert sulkily, because he
knew he had been behaving rather like a pig. &ldquo;No matter who wants
him&mdash;there&rsquo;s no one here to&mdash;anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingratitude,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;is a dreadful
vice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not ungrateful,&rdquo; Jane made haste to say,
&ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> want that wish. Robert only
just said it. Can&rsquo;t you take it back and give us a new
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Sand&ndash;fairy said
shortly; &ldquo;chopping and changing&mdash;it&rsquo;s not business. You ought to be
careful what you <em>do</em> wish. There was a little boy once,
he&rsquo;d wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an Ichthyosaurus, because
he was too lazy to remember the easy names of everyday things, and his
father had been very vexed with him, and had made him go to bed before
tea&ndash;time, and wouldn&rsquo;t let him go out in the nice flint boat
along with the other children,&mdash;it was the annual school&ndash;treat
next day,&mdash;and he came and flung himself down near me on the morning
of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs about and said he
wished he was dead. And of course then he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; said the children all together.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p70" name="70">
<p>&ldquo;Only till sunset, of course,&rdquo; the Psammead said;
&ldquo;still it was quite enough for his father and mother. And he caught
it when he woke up&mdash;I can tell you. He didn&rsquo;t turn to
stone&mdash;I forget why&mdash;but there must have been some reason. They
didn&rsquo;t know being dead is only being asleep, and you&rsquo;re bound
to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep or in some
better place. You may be sure he caught it, giving them such a turn. Why, he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to
taste Megatherium for a month after that. Nothing but oysters and
periwinkles, and common things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale. They looked
at the Psammead in horror. Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something brown
and furry was near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof, poof, poofy,&rdquo; he said, and made a grab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a pussy,&rdquo; Anthea was beginning, when the
Sand&ndash;fairy leaped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my left whisker!&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let him
touch me. He&rsquo;s wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its fur stood on end with horror&mdash;and indeed a good deal of the
ginger&ndash;beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p71" name="71">
<p>The Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and
a whirl of sand.</p>
<p>The children marked the spot with a ring of stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well get along home,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m sorry; but anyway if it&rsquo;s no good
it&rsquo;s no harm, and we know where the sandy thing is for
to&ndash;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were noble. No one reproached Robert at all. Cyril picked up
the Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe
cart&ndash;road.</p>
<p>The cart&ndash;road from the gravel&ndash;pits joins the road almost
directly.</p>
<p>At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from
Cyril&rsquo;s back to Robert&rsquo;s. And as they paused a very smart open
carriage came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside
the carriage a lady&mdash;very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace
and red ribbons and a parasol all red and white&mdash;and a white fluffy
dog on her lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the
children, and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children
were used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a
&ldquo;very taking child&rdquo;. So they waved their hands politely to the
lady and expected her to drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the
coachman stop. And she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the
carriage she said:</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p72" name="72">
<p>&ldquo;What a dear darling duck of a baby!
Oh, I <em>should</em> so like to adopt it! Do you think its mother
would mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d mind very much indeed,&rdquo; said Anthea
shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know. I am Lady
Chittenden. You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers.
They call me a Beauty, you know, but of course that&rsquo;s all nonsense.
Anyway&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>She opened the carriage door and jumped out. She had the wonderfullest
red high&ndash;heeled shoes with silver buckles. &ldquo;Let me hold him a
minute,&rdquo; she said. And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly,
as if she was not used to babies.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and
slammed the door and said, &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive on, I tell you!&rdquo; cried the lady; and the coachman
did, for, as he said afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not
to.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf82" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil082.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p73" name="73">
<p>The four children looked at each other, and then with one accord they 
rushed after the carriage and held on behind.
Down the dusty road went the smart carriage, and after it, at
double&ndash;quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the Lamb&rsquo;s
brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by
slow degree to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still and they knew he had
gone to sleep.</p>
<p>The carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the dust
were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at the lodge
of a grand park. The children crouched down behind the carriage, and the
lady got out. She looked at the Baby as it lay on the carriage seat, and
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The darling&mdash;I won&rsquo;t disturb it,&rdquo; she said, and
went into the lodge to talk to the woman there about a setting of Buff
Orpington eggs that had not turned out well.</p>
<p>The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping
Lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine boy&mdash;wish he was mine,&rdquo; said the coachman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t favour <em>you</em> much,&rdquo; said the
groom sourly; &ldquo;too &rsquo;andsome.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf85" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil085.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p74" name="74">
<p>The coachman pretended not to hear. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder at her now&mdash;I do really! Hates kids. Got none of her
own, and can&rsquo;t abide other folkses&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children, crouching in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged
uncomfortable glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; the coachman went on firmly, &ldquo;blowed
if I don&rsquo;t hide the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his
brothers took &rsquo;im! Then I&rsquo;ll come back for him
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the footman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
took to that kid so as never was. If anyone&rsquo;s to have him, it&rsquo;s
me&mdash;so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stow your gab!&rdquo; the coachman rejoined. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t want no kids, and, if you did, one kid&rsquo;s the same as
another to you. But I&rsquo;m a married man and a judge of breed. I knows a
firstrate yearling when I sees him. I&rsquo;m a&ndash;goin&rsquo; to
&rsquo;ave him, an&rsquo; least said soonest mended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought,&rdquo; said the footman
sneeringly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d a&rsquo;most enough. What with Alfred,
an&rsquo; Albert, an&rsquo; Louise, an&rsquo; Victor Stanley, and Helena
Beatrice, an another&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p75" name="75">
<p>The coachman hit the footman in the chin&mdash;the footman hit the
coachman in the waistcoat&mdash;the next minute the two were fighting here
and there, in and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little
dog jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad.</p>
<p>Cyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of
the carriage farthest from the battlefield. He unfastened the door of the
carriage&mdash;the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel to
notice anything&mdash;took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping,
carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile led
into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and young oaks
and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong&ndash;scented bracken, they
all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were hushed at the angry
voice of the red&ndash;and&ndash;white lady, and, after a 
long and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My only hat!&rdquo; said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the
sound of wheels at last died away. &ldquo;Everyone <em>does</em> want
him now&mdash;and no mistake! That Sammyadd has done us again! Tricky
brute! For any sake, let&rsquo;s get the kid safe home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p76" name="76">
<p>So they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white
road, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage, and
the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb.</p>
<p>Adventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his
back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby, and
then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way twice.
They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert
couldn&rsquo;t make him go away till they had more than once invited him to
smell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a
blue&ndash;and&ndash;white checked pinafore actually followed them for a
quarter of a mile crying for &ldquo;the precious Baby,&rdquo; and then she
was only got rid of by threats of tying her to a tree in the wood with all
their pocket&ndash;handkerchiefs. &ldquo;So that the bears can come and
eat you as soon as it gets dark,&rdquo; said Cyril severely. Then she went
off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the brothers and sisters of the
Baby, who was wanted by everyone, to hide in the hedge whenever they saw
anyone coming, and thus they managed to prevent the Lamb from arousing the
inconvenient affection of a milk&ndash;man, a stone&ndash;breaker, and a
man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at the back of it. They were
nearly home when the worst thing of all happened. Turning a corner suddenly
they came</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p77" name="77">
<p>upon two vans, a tent, and a company of gipsies encamped by the
side of the road. The vans were hung all round with wicker chairs and
cradles, and flower&ndash;stands and feather brushes. A lot of ragged
children were industriously making dust&ndash;pies in the road, two men
lay on the grass smoking, and three women were doing the family washing in
an old red watering&ndash;can with the top broken off.</p>
<p>In a moment every gipsy, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and
the Baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hold him, little lady,&rdquo; said one of the gipsy women,
who had a mahogany&ndash;coloured face and dust&ndash;coloured hair;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt a hair of his head, the little
picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Anthea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let <em>me</em> have him,&rdquo; said the other woman, whose
face was also of the hue of mahogany, and her hair jet&ndash;black, in
greasy curls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nineteen of my own, so I
have.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it
nearly choked her.</p>
<p>Then one of the men pushed forward.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf87" name="">

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p78" name="78">
<p>&ldquo;Swelp me if it ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my own
long&ndash;lost child! Have he a strawberry mark on his left ear? No? Then
he&rsquo;s my own baby, stolen from me in hinnocent hinfancy. &rsquo;And
&rsquo;im over&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll not &rsquo;ave the law on yer this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into
tears of pure rage.</p>
<p>The others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible
thing that had ever happened to them. Even being taken up by the police in
Rochester was nothing to this. Cyril was quite white, and his hands
trembled a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up. He was silent a
minute, thinking hard. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to keep him if he&rsquo;s yours. But you see
he&rsquo;s used to us. You shall have him if you want
him.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no !&rdquo; cried Anthea&mdash;and Cyril glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we want him,&rdquo; said the woman, trying to get the
Baby out of the man&rsquo;s arms. The Lamb howled loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; shrieked Anthea; and Cyril, in a
savage undertone, bade her &ldquo;stow it!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p79" name="79">
<p>&ldquo;You trust to me,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s awfully tiresome with people he doesn&rsquo;t
know very well. Suppose we stay here a bit till he gets used to you, and
then when it&rsquo;s bedtime I give you my word of honour we&rsquo;ll go
away and let you keep him if you want to. And then when we&rsquo;re gone
you can decide which of you is to have him, as you all want him so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; said the man who was holding the
Baby, trying to loosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold
of and drawn round his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly
breathe. The gipsies whispered together, and Cyril took the chance to
whisper too. He said, &ldquo;Sunset! we&rsquo;ll get away then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration
at his having been so clever as to remember this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let him come to us;&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;See,
we&rsquo;ll sit down here and take care of him for you till he gets used to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about dinner?&rdquo; said Robert suddenly. The others looked
at him with scorn. &ldquo;Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when
your br&mdash;I mean when the Baby&rdquo;&mdash;Jane whispered hotly.
Robert carefully winked at her and went on:</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf90" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil090.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p80" name="80">
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind my just running home to get our
dinner?&rdquo; he said to the gipsies; &ldquo;I can bring it out here in a
basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brothers and sisters felt themselves very noble, and despised him.
They did not know his thoughtful secret intention. But the gipsies did in a
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;and then fetch the
police with a pack of lies about it being your baby instead of ours !
D&rsquo;jever catch a weasel asleep?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re hungry you can pick a bit along of us,&rdquo;
said the light&ndash;haired gipsy woman, not unkindly. &ldquo;Here Levi,
that blessed kid&rsquo;ll howl all his buttons off. Give him to the little
lady, and let&rsquo;s see if they can&rsquo;t get him used to us a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Lamb was handed back; but the gipsies crowded so closely that he
could not possibly stop howling. Then the man with the red handkerchief
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Pharaoh, make up the fire; and you girls see to the pot.
Give the kid a chanst.&rdquo; So the gipsies, very much against their will,
went off to their work, and the children and the Lamb were left sitting on
the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right at sunset,&rdquo; Jane whispered.
&ldquo;But, oh, it is awful! Suppose they are frightfully angry when they
come to their senses! They might beat us, or leave us tied to trees, or
something.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p81" name="81">
<p>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Anthea said. (&ldquo;Oh, my Lamb,
don&rsquo;t cry any more, it&rsquo;s all right, Panty&rsquo;s
got oo, duckie!&rdquo;) &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t unkind people, or they
wouldn&rsquo;t be going to give us any dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch their
nasty dinner. It would choke me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others thought so too then. But when the dinner was ready&mdash;it
turned out to be supper, and happened between four and five&mdash;they were
all glad enough to take what they could get. It was boiled rabbit, with
onions, and some bird rather like a chicken, but stringier about its legs
and with a stronger taste. The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown
sugar sprinkled on the top. He liked this very much, and consented to let
the two gipsy women feed him with it, as he sat on Anthea&rsquo;s lap. All
that long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep
the Lamb amused and happy, while the gipsies looked eagerly on. By the time
the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really
&ldquo;taken to&rdquo; the woman with the light hair, and even consented to
kiss his hand to the children, and to stand up and bow, with his hand on
his chest&mdash; &ldquo;like a gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;to the two men. The whole gipsy camp
was in raptures with him, and his brothers and sisters could</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p82" name="82">
<p>not help
taking some pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so
interested and enthusiastic. But they longed for sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting into the habit of longing for sunset,&rdquo;
Cyril whispered. &ldquo;How I do wish we could wish something really
sensible, that would be of some use, so that we should be quite sorry when
sunset came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadows got longer and longer, and at last there were no separate
shadows any more, but one soft glowing shadow over everything; for the sun
was out of sight&mdash;behind the hill&mdash;but he had not really set yet.
The people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people
who decide when the sun sets; she has to do it, too, to the minute, or they
would know the reason why!</p>
<p>But the gipsies were getting impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young uns,&rdquo; the red&ndash;handkerchief man said,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s time you were laying of your heads on your
pillows&mdash;so it is! The kid&rsquo;s all right and friendly with us
now&mdash;so you just hand him over and sling that hook o&rsquo; yours like you
said.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p83" name="83">
<p>The women and children came crowding round the Lamb, arms were held out,
fingers snapped invitingly, friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles;
but all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb. He clung with arms and legs to
Jane, who happened to be holding him, and uttered the gloomiest roar of the
whole day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;hand the little
poppet over, miss. We&rsquo;ll soon quiet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still the sun would not set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her about how to put him to bed,&rdquo; whispered Cyril;
&ldquo;anything to gain time&mdash;and be ready to bolt when the sun really
does make up its silly old mind to set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll hand him over in just one minute,&rdquo; Anthea
began, talking very fast &mdash;&ldquo;but do let me just tell you he has a
warm bath every night and cold in the morning, and he has a crockery rabbit
to go into the warm bath with him, and little Samuel saying his prayers in
white china on a red cushion for the cold bath;
and he hates you to wash his ears, but you must; and if you let the soap
get into his eyes, the Lamb&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamb kyes,&rdquo; said he&mdash;he had stopped roaring to
listen.</p>
<p>The woman laughed. &ldquo;As if I hadn&rsquo;t never bath&rsquo;d a
babby!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come&mdash;give us a hold of him. Come to
&rsquo;Melia, my precious.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p84" name="84">
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;way, ugsie!&rdquo; replied the Lamb at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; Anthea went on, &ldquo;about his meals; you
really <em>must</em> let me tell you he has an apple or a banana every
morning, and bread&ndash;and&ndash;milk for breakfast, and an egg for his
tea sometimes, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought up ten,&rdquo; said the black&ndash;ringleted
woman, &ldquo;besides the others. Come, miss, &rsquo;and &rsquo;im
over&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it no longer. I just must give him a
hug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t settled yet whose he&rsquo;s to be, Esther,&rdquo;
said one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be you, Esther, with seven of &rsquo;em at your
tail a&rsquo;ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure of that,&rdquo; said Esther&rsquo;s
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t I nobody, to have a say neither?&rdquo; said the
husband of &rsquo;Melia.</p>
<p>Zillah, the girl, said, &ldquo;An&rsquo; me? I&rsquo;m a single
girl&mdash;and no one but &rsquo;im to look after&mdash;I ought to have
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you show me no more of your impudence!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="bookPage" id="p85" name="85">
<p>Everyone was getting very angry. The dark gipsy faces were frowning and
anxious&ndash;looking. Suddenly a change swept over them, as if some
invisible sponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions, and
left only a blank.</p>
<p>The children saw that the sun really <em>had</em> set. But they were
afraid to move. And the gipsies were feeling so muddled, because of the
invisible sponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out
of their hearts, that they could not say a word.</p>
<p>The children hardly dared to breathe. Suppose the gipsies, when they
recovered speech, should be furious to think how silly they had been all
day?</p>
<p>It was an awkward moment. Suddenly Anthea, greatly daring, held out the
Lamb to the red&ndash;handkerchief man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The man drew back. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to deprive you
miss,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who likes can have my share of him,&rdquo; said the other
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, I&rsquo;ve got enough of my own,&rdquo; said
Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice little chap, though,&rdquo; said Amelia. She
was the only one who now looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p86" name="86">
<p>Zillah said, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t think I must have had a touch of
the sun. <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall we take him away?&rdquo; said Anthea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;suppose you do,&rdquo; said Pharaoh heartily,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll say no more about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents
for the night. All but Amelia. She went with the children as far as the
bend in the road&mdash;and there she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me give him a kiss, miss&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know what made us go for to behave so silly. Us gipsies don&rsquo;t steal
babies, whatever they may tell you when you&rsquo;re naughty. We&rsquo;ve
enough of our own, mostly. But I&rsquo;ve lost all mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned towards the Lamb; and he, looking in her eyes, unexpectedly
put up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor!&rdquo; said the Lamb. And he let the gipsy woman kiss
him, and, what is more, he kissed her brown cheek in return&mdash;a very
nice kiss, as all his kisses are, and not a wet one like some babies give.
The gipsy woman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been
writing something there, and the same with his chest and his hands and his
feet; then she said:</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p87" name="87">
<p>&ldquo;May he be brave, and have the strong head to think with, and the
strong heart to love with, and the strong hands to work with, and the
strong feet to travel with, and always come safe home to his own.&rdquo;
Then she said something in a strange language no one could understand, and
suddenly added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be saying &lsquo;so long&rsquo;&mdash;and glad to have made your acquaintance.&rdquo; And she turned and went back to
her home&mdash;the tent by the grassy roadside.</p>
<p>The children looked after her till she was out of sight. Then Robert
said, &ldquo;How silly of her! Even sunset didn&rsquo;t put
<em>her</em> right. What rot she talked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;if you ask me, I think it was
rather decent of her&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decent?&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;it was very nice indeed of
her. I think she&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just too frightfully nice for anything,&rdquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>And they went home&mdash;very late for tea and unspeakably late for
dinner. Martha scolded, of course. But the Lamb was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as
anyone,&rdquo; said Robert later.</p>

<div class="bookPage" id="p88" name="88">
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you feel different about it now the sun&rsquo;s
set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>No</em>,&rdquo; said all the others together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s lasted over sunset with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cyril explained. &ldquo;The wish
didn&rsquo;t do anything to <em>us</em>. We always wanted him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves, only we were all
pigs this morning; especially you, Robert.&rdquo; Robert bore this much
with a strange calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly <em>thought</em> I didn&rsquo;t want him this
morning,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Perhaps I <em>was</em> a pig. But
everything looked so different when we thought we were going to lose
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that, my dear children, is the moral of this chapter. I did not mean
it to have a moral, but morals are nasty forward beings, and will keep
shoving their oars in where they are not wanted. And since the moral has
sneaked in, quite against my wishes, you might as well think of it next
time you feel piggy yourself and want to get rid of any of your brothers
and sisters. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t often happen, but I daresay it has
happened sometimes, even to you!</p>
