<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
BIGGER THAN THE BAKER&rsquo;S BOY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>LOOK</strong> here,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it hurt much?&rdquo; said Robert sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a jackape! I&rsquo;m not humbugging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Bobs!&rdquo; said Anthea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence for the Squirrel&rsquo;s oration,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>Cyril balanced himself on the edge of the water&ndash;butt in the
backyard, where they all happened to be, and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, Romans, countrymen&mdash;and women&mdash;we found a
Sammyadd. We have had wishes. We&rsquo;ve had wings, and being beautiful as
the day&mdash;ugh!&mdash;that was pretty jolly beastly if you
like&mdash;and wealth and castles, and that rotten gipsy business with the
Lamb. But
we&rsquo;re no forrader. We haven&rsquo;t really got anything worth having
for our wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had things happening,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s always something.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p168" name="168">
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough, unless they&rsquo;re the right
things,&rdquo; said Cyril firmly. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve been
thinking&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; whispered Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the silent what&rsquo;s&ndash;its&ndash;names of the night.
It&rsquo;s like suddenly being asked something out of history&mdash;the
date of the Conquest or something; you know it all right all the time, but
when you&rsquo;re asked it all goes out of your head. Ladies and gentlemen,
you know jolly well that when we&rsquo;re all rotting about in the usual
way heaps of things keep cropping up, and then real earnest wishes come
into the heads of the beholder&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;of the beholder, however stupid he is,&rdquo; Cyril went
on. &ldquo;Why, even Robert might happen to think of a really useful wish
if he didn&rsquo;t injure his poor little brains trying so hard to
think.&mdash;Shut up, Bobs, I tell you!&mdash;You&rsquo;ll have the whole
show over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A struggle on the edge of a water&ndash;butt is exciting, but damp.
When it was over, and the boys were partially dried, Anthea said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really was you began it, Bobs. Now honour is satisfied, do let
Squirrel go on. We&rsquo;re wasting the whole morning.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p169" name="169">
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Cyril, still wringing the water out of the
tails of his jacket, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it pax if Bobs will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pax then,&rdquo; said Robert sulkily. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got a
lump as big as a cricket ball over my eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthea patiently offered a dust&ndash;coloured handkerchief, and Robert
bathed his wounds in silence. &ldquo;Now, Squirrel,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;let&rsquo;s just play bandits, or forts, or
soldiers, or any of the old games. We&rsquo;re dead sure to think of
something if we try not to. You always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others consented. Bandits was hastily chosen for the game.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as anything else,&rdquo; said Jane gloomily. It
must be owned that Robert was at first but a half&ndash;hearted bandit,
but when Anthea had borrowed from Martha the red spotted handkerchief in
which the keeper had brought her mushrooms that morning, and had tied up
Robert&rsquo;s head with it so that he could be the wounded hero who had
saved the bandit captain&rsquo;s life the day before, he cheered up
wonderfully. All were soon armed. Bows and arrows slung on the back look
well; and umbrellas and cricket stumps stuck through the belt give a fine
impression of the wearer&rsquo;s being armed to the teeth. The white cotton
hats that men wear in the country nowadays have a very brigandish effect
when a few turkey&rsquo;s feathers are stuck in them. The Lamb&rsquo;s
mail&ndash;cart</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p170" name="170">
<p>was covered with a red&ndash;and&ndash;blue checked
tablecloth, and made an admirable baggage&ndash;waggon. The Lamb asleep
inside of it was not at all in the way. So the banditti set out along the
road that led to the sand&ndash;pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be near the Sammyadd,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;in
case we think of anything suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is all very well to make up your minds to play bandits&mdash;or
chess, or ping&ndash;pong, or any other agreeable game&mdash;but it is not
easy to do it with spirit when all the wonderful
wishes you can think of, or can&rsquo;t think of, are waiting for you round
the corner. The game was dragging a little, and some of the bandits were
beginning to feel that the others were disagreeable things, and were saying
so candidly, when the baker&rsquo;s boy came along the road with loaves in
a basket. The opportunity was not one to be lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand and deliver!&rdquo; cried Cyril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your money or your life!&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>And they stood on each side of the baker&rsquo;s boy. Unfortunately he
did not seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all. He was a
baker&rsquo;s boy of an unusually large size. He merely said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chuck it now, d&rsquo;ye hear!&rdquo; and pushed the bandits
aside most disrespectfully.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p171" name="171">
<p>Then Robert lassoed him with Jane&rsquo;s skipping&ndash;rope, and
instead of going round his shoulders, as Robert intended, it went round his
feet and tripped him up. The basket was upset, the beautiful new loaves
went bumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road. The girls ran to
pick them up, and all in a moment Robert and the
baker&rsquo;s boy were fighting it out, man to man, with Cyril to see fair
play, and the skipping&ndash;rope twisting round their legs like an
interested snake that wished to be a peace&ndash;maker. It did not
succeed; indeed the way the boxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters
on the shins and ankles was not at all peace&ndash;making. I know this is
the second fight&mdash;or contest&mdash;in this chapter, but I can&rsquo;t
help it. It was that sort of day. You know yourself there are days when
rows seem to keep on happening, quite without your meaning them to. If I
were a writer of tales of adventure such as those which used to appear in
<em>The Boys of England</em> when I was young, of course I should be
able to describe the fight, but I cannot do it. I never can see what
happens during a fight, even when it is only dogs. Also, if I had been one
of these <em>Boys of England</em> writers, Robert would have got the
best of it. But I am like George Washington&mdash;I cannot tell a lie, even
about a cherry&ndash;tree, much less about a fight, and I cannot conceal
from you that Robert was badly beaten, for the second time that
day. The baker&rsquo;s boy blacked his other eye, and, being ignorant of
the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p172" name="172">
<p>behaviour, he also pulled Robert&rsquo;s hair, and kicked him on the knee. Robert always used to say
he could have licked the butcher if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the girls. But
I am not sure. Anyway, what happened was this, and very painful it was to
self&ndash;respecting boys.</p>
<p>Cyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper
style, when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask him
not to go and be beaten too. That &ldquo;too&rdquo; was very nice for
Robert, as you can imagine&mdash;but it was nothing to what he felt when
Anthea rushed in between him and the baker&rsquo;s boy, and caught that
unfair and degraded fighter round the waist, imploring him not to fight any
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurt my brother any more!&rdquo; she said in
floods of tears. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;it&rsquo;s only play.
And I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see how unfair this was to Robert. Because, if the baker&rsquo;s boy
had had any right and chivalrous instincts, and had yielded to Anthea&rsquo;s pleading and
accepted her despicable apology, Robert could not, in honour, have done
anything to him at any future time. But Robert&rsquo;s fears, if he had
any, were soon dispelled. Chivalry was a stranger to the breast of the
baker&rsquo;s boy. He pushed Anthea away very roughly, and he chased Robert
with</p>

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p173" name="173">
<p>kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the road to the
sand&ndash;pit, and there, with one last kick, he landed him in a heap of
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll larn you, you young varmint!&rdquo; he said, and went
off to pick up his loaves and go about his business. Cyril, impeded by
Jane, could do nothing without hurting her, for she clung round his legs
with the strength of despair. The baker&rsquo;s boy went off red and damp
about the face; abusive to the last, he called them a pack of silly idiots,
and disappeared round the corner. Then Jane&rsquo;s grasp loosened. Cyril
turned away in silent dignity to follow Robert, and the girls followed him,
weeping without restraint.</p>
<p>It was not a happy party that flung itself
down in the sand beside the sobbing Robert. For Robert was
sobbing&mdash;mostly with rage. Though of course I know that a really
heroic boy is always dry&ndash;eyed after a fight. But then he always
wins, which had not been the case with Robert.</p>
<p>Cyril was angry with Jane; Robert was furious with Anthea; the girls
were miserable; and not one of the four was pleased with the baker&rsquo;s
boy. There was, as French writers say, &ldquo;a silence full of
emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Robert dug his toes and his hands into the sand and wriggled in his
rage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better wait till I&rsquo;m grown up</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p174" name="174">
<p>&mdash;the
cowardly brute! Beast!&mdash;I hate him! But I&rsquo;ll pay him out. Just
because he&rsquo;s bigger than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You began,&rdquo; said Jane incautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did, silly&mdash;but I was only rotting&mdash;and he
kicked me&mdash;look here&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Robert tore down a stocking and showed a purple bruise touched up with
red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I was bigger than him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dug his fingers in the sand, and sprang
up, for his hand had touched something furry. It was the Psammead, of
course &mdash;&ldquo;On the look&ndash;out to make sillies of them as
usual,&rdquo; as Cyril remarked later. And of course the next moment
Robert&rsquo;s wish was granted, and he was bigger than the baker&rsquo;s
boy. Oh, but much, much bigger. He was bigger than the big policeman who
used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years ago,&mdash;the one
who was so kind in helping old ladies over the crossing,&mdash;and he was
the biggest man <em>I</em> have ever seen, as well as the kindest. No
one had a foot&ndash;rule in its pocket, so Robert could not be
measured&mdash;but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on
your mother&rsquo;s head, which I am sure he would never be unkind enough
to do. He must have been ten or eleven feet high, and as broad as a boy of
that height ought to be. His Norfolk suit had</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p175" name="175">
<p>fortunately grown too, and
now he stood up in it&mdash;with one of his enormous stockings turned down
to show the gigantic bruise on his vast leg. Immense tears of fury still
stood on his flushed giant face. He looked so surprised, and he was so
large to be wearing an Eton collar, that the others could not help laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sammyadd&rsquo;s done us again,&rdquo; said Cyril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not us&mdash;<em>me</em>,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;d got any decent feeling you&rsquo;d try to make it make you the
same size. You&rsquo;ve no idea how silly it feels,&rdquo; he added
thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to; I can jolly well see how silly it
looks,&rdquo; Cyril was beginning; but Anthea said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>don&rsquo;t</em>! I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the
matter with you boys to&ndash;day. Look here, Squirrel, let&rsquo;s play
fair. It is hateful for poor old Bobs, all alone up there. Let&rsquo;s ask
the Sammyadd for another wish, and, if it will, I do really think we ought
to be made the same size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed, but not gaily; but when they found the Psammead, it
wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; it said crossly, rubbing its face with its feet.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rude violent boy, and it&rsquo;ll do him good to be the
wrong size for a bit. What did he want to come digging me out with his
nasty wet hands for? He nearly touched me! He&rsquo;s a perfect savage. A
boy of the Stone Age would have had more sense.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p176" name="176">
<p>Robert&rsquo;s hands had indeed been wet&mdash;with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away and leave me in peace, do,&rdquo; the Psammead went on.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you don&rsquo;t wish for something sensible
&mdash; something to eat or drink, or good manners, or good tempers. Go
along with you, do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It almost snarled as it shook its whiskers, and turned a sulky brown
back on them. The most hopeful felt that further parley was vain.</p>
<p>They turned again to the colossal Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever shall we do?&rdquo; they said; and they all said it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Robert grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
reason with that baker&rsquo;s boy. I shall catch him at the end of the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit a chap littler than yourself, old man,&rdquo;
said Cyril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like hitting him?&rdquo; said Robert scornfully.
&ldquo;Why, I should <em>kill</em> him. But I&rsquo;ll give him
something to remember. Wait till I pull up my stocking.&rdquo; He pulled up
his stocking, which was as large as a small bolster&ndash;case, and strode
off. His strides were six or seven feet long, so that it was quite easy for him to be at the
bottom of the hill, ready to meet the baker&rsquo;s boy when he came down
swinging the empty basket to meet his master&rsquo;s cart, which had been
leaving bread at the cottages along the road.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf207" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil207.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p177" name="177">
<p>Robert crouched behind a haystack in the farmyard, that is at the
corner, and when he heard the boy come whistling along he jumped out at him
and caught him by the collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was about four times its usual
size, just as his body was four times its, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to teach
you to kick boys smaller than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted up the baker&rsquo;s boy and set him on the top of the
haystack, which was about sixteen feet from the ground, and then he sat
down on the roof of the cowshed and told the baker&rsquo;s boy exactly what
he thought of him. I don&rsquo;t think the boy heard it all&mdash;he was in
a sort of trance of terror. When Robert has said everything he could think
of, and some things twice over, he shook the boy and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now get down the best way you can,&rdquo; and left him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the baker&rsquo;s boy got down, but I do know
that he missed the cart, and got into the very hottest of hot water when he
turned up at last at the bakehouse. I am sorry for him, but, after all, it
was quite right that he should be taught that English boys mustn&rsquo;t
use their feet when they fight, but their fists. Of course the water he got
into only became hotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he
had licked and the giant as high as a church, because no one could possibly
believe</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p178" name="178">
<p>such a tale as that. Next day the tale was believed&mdash;but that
was too late to be of any use to the baker&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<p>When Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden. Anthea had
thoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there&mdash;because
the dining&ndash;room was rather small, and it would have been so awkward
to have a brother the size of Robert in there. The Lamb, who had slept
peacefully during the whole stormy morning, was now found to be sneezing,
and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And really it&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; said Cyril,
&ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d ever have stopped screaming if
he&rsquo;d once seen you the awful size you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert was indeed what a draper would call an
&ldquo;out&ndash;size&rdquo; in boys. He found himself able to step right
over the iron gate in the front garden.</p>
<p>Martha brought out the dinner&mdash;it was cold veal and baked potatoes,
with sago pudding and stewed plums to follow.</p>
<p>She of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual
size, and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more. You
have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you are many
times your proper size. Robert groaned, and asked</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p179" name="179">
<p>for more bread. But
Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever. She was in a hurry,
because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst Fair, and she
wished to be dressed smartly before he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish <em>we</em> were going to the Fair,&rdquo; said
Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go anywhere that size,&rdquo; said Cyril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;They have giants at fairs,
much bigger ones than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cyril was beginning, when Jane
screamed &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; with such loud suddenness that they all thumped
her on the back and asked whether she had swallowed a
plum&ndash;stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, breathless from being thumped,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a plum&ndash;stone. It&rsquo;s an
idea. Let&rsquo;s take Robert to the Fair, and get them to give us money
for showing him! Then we really <em>shall</em> get something out of the
old Sammyadd at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me indeed!&rdquo; said Robert indignantly. &ldquo;Much more
likely me take you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it turned out. The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but
Robert, and even he was brought round by Anthea&rsquo;s suggestion that he
should have a double share of any money they might make. There was a little
old</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p180" name="180">
<p>pony&ndash;trap in the coach&ndash;house&mdash;the kind that is
called a governess&ndash;cart. It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as
quickly as possible, so Robert&mdash; who could now take enormous steps and
so go very fast indeed&mdash;
consented to wheel the others in this. It was as easy to him now as
wheeling the Lamb in the mail&ndash;cart had been in the morning. The
Lamb&rsquo;s cold prevented his being of the party.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a pony&ndash;carriage by a
giant. Everyone enjoyed the journey except Robert and the few people they
passed on the way. These mostly went into what looked like some kind of
standing&ndash;up fits by the roadside, as Anthea said. Just outside
Benenhurst, Robert hid in a barn, and the others went on to the Fair.</p>
<p>There were some swings, and a hooting&ndash;tooting blaring
merry&ndash;go&ndash;round, and a shooting&ndash;gallery and
cocoanut&ndash;shies. Resisting an impulse to win a cocoanut,&mdash;or at
least to attempt the enterprise,&mdash;Cyril went up to the woman who was
loading little guns before the array of glass bottles on strings against a
sheet of canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, little gentleman!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Penny a
shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we are here on business,
not on pleasure. Who&rsquo;s the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf213" name="">

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p181" name="181">
<p>&ldquo;The master&mdash;the head&mdash;the boss of the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a stout man in a dirty
linen jacket who was sleeping in the sun; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t advise
you to wake him sudden. His temper&rsquo;s contrary, especially these hot
days. Better have a shot while you&rsquo;re waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather important,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be very profitable to him. I think he&rsquo;ll be sorry
if we take it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s money in his pocket,&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;No kid now? What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>giant</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> kidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along and see,&rdquo; said Anthea.</p>
<p>The woman looked doubtfully at them, then she called to a ragged little
girl in striped stockings and a dingy white petticoat that came below her
brown frock, and leaving her in charge of the
&ldquo;shooting&ndash;gallery&rdquo; she turned to Anthea and said,
&ldquo;Well, hurry up! But if you <em>are</em> kidding, you&rsquo;d
best say so. I&rsquo;m as mild as milk myself, but my Bill he&rsquo;s a
fair terror and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Anthea led the way to the barn. &ldquo;It really <em>is</em> a
giant,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a giant little boy&mdash;in
Norfolks like my brother&rsquo;s there. And we didn&rsquo;t bring him up to
the Fair</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p182" name="182">
<p>because people do stare so, and they seem to go into kind of
standing&ndash;up fits when they see him. And we thought perhaps
you&rsquo;d like to show him and get pennies; and if you like to pay us
something, you can&mdash;only, it&rsquo;ll have to be rather a lot, because
we promised him he should have a double share of whatever we
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman murmured something indistinct, of which the children could
only hear the words, &ldquo;Swelp me!&rdquo; &ldquo;balmy,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;crumpet,&rdquo; which conveyed no definite idea to their minds.</p>
<p>She had taken Anthea&rsquo;s hand, and was holding it very firmly; and
Anthea could not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have
wandered off or turned his proper size during the interval. But she knew
that the Psammead&rsquo;s gifts really did last till sunset, however
inconvenient their lasting might be; and she did not think somehow,
that Robert would care to go out alone while he was that size.</p>
<p>When they reached the barn and Cyril called &ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; there
was a stir among the loose hay, and Robert began to come out. His hand and
arm came first&mdash;then a foot and leg. When the woman saw the hand she
said &ldquo;My!&rdquo; but when she saw the foot she said &ldquo;Upon my
civvy!&rdquo; and when, by slow and heavy degrees, the whole of
Robert&rsquo;s enormous bulk was at last completely disclosed, she drew</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p183" name="183">
<p>a long breath and began to say many things, compared with which
&ldquo;balmy&rdquo; and &ldquo;crumpet&rdquo; seemed quite ordinary. She
dropped into understandable English at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you take for him?&rdquo; she said excitedly.
&ldquo;Anything in reason. We&rsquo;d have a special van
built&mdash;leastways, I know where there&rsquo;s a second&ndash;hand one
would do up handsome&mdash;what a baby elephant had, as died. What&rsquo;ll
you take? He&rsquo;s soft, ain&rsquo;t he? Them giants mostly is&mdash;but
I never see&mdash;no never! What&rsquo;ll you take? Down on the nail.
We&rsquo;ll treat him like a king,
and give him first&ndash;rate grub and a doss fit for a bloomin&rsquo;
dook. He must be dotty or he wouldn&rsquo;t need you kids to cart him
about. What&rsquo;ll you take for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take anything,&rdquo; said Robert sternly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more soft than you are&mdash;not so much, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. I&rsquo;ll come and be a show for to&ndash;day if
you&rsquo;ll give me&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated at the enormous price he was
about to ask&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll give me fifteen
shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the woman, so quickly that Robert felt he had
been unfair to himself, and wished he had asked thirty. &ldquo;Come on
now&mdash;and see my Bill&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll fix a price for the season.
I dessay you might get as much as two quid a week reg&rsquo;lar. Come
on&mdash;and make yourself as small as you can, for gracious&rsquo;
sake!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p184" name="184">
<p>This was not very small, and a crowd gathered quickly, so that it was at
the head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled
meadow where the Fair was held, and passed over the stubbly yellow dusty
grass to the door of the biggest tent.
He crept in, and the woman went to call her Bill. He was the big sleeping
man, and he did not seem at all pleased at being awakened. Cyril, watching
through a slit in the tent, saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a
sleepy head. Then the woman went on speaking very fast. Cyril heard
&ldquo;Strewth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;biggest draw you ever, so help me!&rdquo;
and he began to share Robert&rsquo;s feeling that fifteen shillings was
indeed far too little. Bill slouched up to the tent and entered. When he
beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert he said but
little,&mdash;&ldquo;Strike me pink!&rdquo; were the only words the
children could afterwards remember,&mdash;but he produced fifteen
shillings, mainly in sixpences and coppers, and handed it to Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix up about what you&rsquo;re to draw when the
show&rsquo;s over to&ndash;night,&rdquo; he said with hoarse heartiness.
&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; love a duck! you&rsquo;ll be that happy with us
you&rsquo;ll never want to leave us. Can you do a song now&mdash;or a bit
of a breakdown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to&ndash;day,&rdquo; said Robert, rejecting the
idea of trying to sing &ldquo;As once in May,&rdquo; a favourite of his
mother&rsquo;s, and the only song he could think of at the moment.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p185" name="185">
<p>&ldquo;Get Levi and clear them bloomin&rsquo; photos out. Clear the
tent. Stick up a curtain or suthink,&rdquo; the man went on.
&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, what a pity we ain&rsquo;t got no tights his size ! But
we&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em before the week&rsquo;s out. Young man, your
fortune&rsquo;s made. It&rsquo;s a good thing you came to me, and not to
some chaps as I could tell you on. I&rsquo;ve known blokes as beat their
giants, and starved &rsquo;em too; so I&rsquo;ll tell you straight,
you&rsquo;re in luck this day if you never was afore. &rsquo;Cos I&rsquo;m
a lamb, I am&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t deceive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anyone&rsquo;s beating
<em>me</em>,&rdquo; said Robert, looking down on the
&ldquo;lamb.&rdquo; Robert was crouched on his knees, because the tent was
not big enough for him to stand upright in, but even in that position he
could still look down on most people. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m awfully
hungry&mdash;I wish you&rsquo;d get me something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, &rsquo;Becca,&rdquo; said hoarse Bill. &ldquo;Get him some
grub&mdash; the best you&rsquo;ve got, mind!&rdquo;
Another whisper followed, of which the children only heard, &ldquo;Down in
black and white&mdash;first thing to&ndash;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman went to get the food&mdash;it was only bread and cheese
when it came, but it was delightful to the large and empty Robert; and the
man went to post sentinels round the tent, to give the alarm if Robert
should attempt to escape with his fifteen shillings.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p186" name="186">
<p>&ldquo;As if we weren&rsquo;t honest,&rdquo; said Anthea indignantly
when the meaning of the sentinels dawned on her.</p>
<p>Then began a very strange and wonderful afternoon.</p>
<p>Bill was a man who knew his business. In a very little while, the
photographic views, the spyglasses you look at them through so that they
really seem rather real, and the lights you see them by, were all packed
away. A curtain&mdash;it was an old red&ndash;and&ndash;black carpet
really&mdash;was run across the tent. Robert was concealed behind, and Bill
was standing on a trestle&ndash;table outside the tent making a speech. It
was rather a good speech. It began by
saying that the giant it was his privilege to introduce to the public that
day was the eldest son of the Emperor of San Francisco, compelled through
an unfortunate love affair with the Duchess of the Fiji Islands to leave
his own country and take refuge in England&mdash;the land of
liberty&mdash;where freedom was the right of every man, no matter how big
he was. It ended by the announcement that the first twenty who came to the
tent door should see the giant for threepence apiece. &ldquo;After
that,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;the price is riz, and I don&rsquo;t
undertake to say what it won&rsquo;t be riz to. So now&rsquo;s yer
time.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p187" name="187">
<p>A young man squiring his sweetheart on her afternoon out was the first
to come forward. For that occasion his was the princely attitude&mdash;no
expense spared&mdash;money no object. His girl wished to see the giant?
Well, she should see the giant, even though seeing the giant cost
threepence each and the other entertainments were all penny ones.</p>
<p>The flap of the tent was raised&mdash;the couple entered. Next moment a
wild shriek from the girl thrilled all present. Bill
slapped his leg. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s done the trick!&rdquo; he whispered to
&rsquo;Becca. It was indeed a splendid advertisement of the charms of
Robert. When the girl came out she was pale and trembling, and a crowd was
round the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; asked a bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;horrid!&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as big as a barn, and that fierce. It froze the
blood in my bones. I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; missed seeing it for
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierceness was only caused by Robert&rsquo;s trying not to laugh.
But the desire to do that soon left him, and before sunset he was more
inclined to cry than to laugh, and more inclined to sleep than either. For,
by ones and twos and threes people kept coming in all the afternoon, and
Robert had to shake hands with those who wished it, and</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p188" name="188">
<p>to allow himself to be punched and pulled and patted and thumped, so that people might make
sure he was really real.</p>
<p>The other children sat on a bench and watched and waited, and were very
bored indeed. It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning money
that could have been invented. And only fifteen shillings! Bill had taken
four times that already, for the news of the giant had spread, and
tradespeople in carts, and gentlepeople in carriages, came from far and
near. One gentleman with an eyeglass, and a very large yellow rose in his
buttonhole, offered Robert, in an obliging whisper ten pounds a week to
appear at the Crystal Palace. Robert had to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said regretfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no
use promising what you can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor fellow, bound for a term of years, I suppose! Well,
here&rsquo;s my card; when your time&rsquo;s up come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;if I&rsquo;m the same size then,&rdquo; said Robert
truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you grow a bit, so much the better,&rdquo; said the
gentleman.</p>
<p>When he had gone, Robert beckoned Cyril and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them I must and will have an easy. And I want my
tea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="bookPage" id="p189" name="189">
<p>Tea was provided, and a paper hastily pinned on the tent. It
said&mdash;</p>
<p>CLOSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE THE GIANT GETS HIS TEA.</p>
<p>Then there was a hurried council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to get away?&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about it all the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, walk out when the sun sets and you&rsquo;re your right size.
They can&rsquo;t do anything to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert opened his eyes. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;d nearly kill us,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;when they saw me get my right size. No, we must think of
some other way. We <em>must</em> be alone when the sun sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Cyril briskly, and he went to the door,
outside which Bill was smoking a clay pipe and talking in a low voice to
&rsquo;Becca. Cyril heard him say&mdash;&ldquo;Good as havin&rsquo; a
fortune left you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;you can let people come in
again in a minute. He&rsquo;s nearly finished his tea. But he
<em>must</em> be left alone when the sun sets. He&rsquo;s very queer at
that
time of day, and if he&rsquo;s worried I won&rsquo;t answer for the
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what comes over him?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p190" name="190">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sort of a
<em>change</em>,&rdquo; said Cyril candidly. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t at
all like himself&mdash;you&rsquo;d hardly know him. He&rsquo;s very queer
indeed. Someone&rsquo;ll get hurt if he&rsquo;s not alone about
sunset.&rdquo; This was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pull round for the evening, I
s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;half an hour after sunset he&rsquo;ll be quite
himself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best to humour him,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>And so, at what Cyril judged was about half an hour before sunset, the
tent was again closed, &ldquo;whilst the giant gets his supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was very merry about the giant&rsquo;s meals and their coming
so close together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can pick a bit,&rdquo; Bill owned. &ldquo;You see he has
to eat hearty, being the size he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the tent the four children breathlessly arranged a plan of
retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go <em>now</em>,&rdquo; said Cyril to the girls,
&ldquo;and get along home as fast as you can. Oh, never mind the beastly
pony&ndash;cart; we&rsquo;ll get that to&ndash;
morrow. Robert and I are dressed the same. We&rsquo;ll manage somehow, like
Sydney Carton did. Only, you girls <em>must</em> get out, or it&rsquo;s
all no go. We can run, but you can&rsquo;t&mdash;whatever you may think.
No, Jane, it&rsquo;s no</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p191" name="191">
<p>good Robert going out and knocking people down. The
police would follow him till he turned his proper size, and then arrest him
like a shot. Go you must! If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll never speak to you
again. It was you got us into this mess really, hanging round
people&rsquo;s legs the way you did this morning. <em>Go</em>, I tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jane and Anthea went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home,&rdquo; they said to Bill.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving the giant with you. Be kind to him.&rdquo; And
that, as Anthea said afterwards, was very deceitful, but what were they to
do?</p>
<p>When they had gone, Cyril went to Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he wants some ears of
corn&mdash;there&rsquo;s some in the next field but one. I&rsquo;ll just
run and get it. Oh, and he says can&rsquo;t you loop up the tent at the
back a bit? He says he&rsquo;s stifling for a breath of air. I&rsquo;ll see
no one peeps in at him. I&rsquo;ll cover him up, and he can take a nap
while I go for the corn.
He *will* have it&mdash;there&rsquo;s no holding him when he gets like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant was made comfortable with a heap of sacks and an old
tarpaulin. The curtain was looped up, and the brothers were left alone.
They matured their plans in whispers. Outside, the
merry&ndash;go&ndash;round blared out its comic tunes, screaming now and
then to attract public notice.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p192" name="192">
<p>Half a minute after the sun had set, a boy in a Norfolk suit came out
past Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off for the corn,&rdquo; he said, and mingled quickly
with the crowd.</p>
<p>At the same instant a boy came out of the back of the tent past
&rsquo;Becca, posted there as sentinel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off after the corn,&rdquo; said this boy also. And he,
too moved away quietly and was lost in the crowd. The front&ndash;door boy
was Cyril; the back&ndash;door was Robert&mdash;now, since sunset, once
more his proper size. They walked quickly through the field, and along the
road, where Robert caught Cyril up. Then they ran. They were home as soon
as the girls were, for it was a long way, and they ran most
of it. It was indeed a <em>very</em> long way, as they found when they
had to go and drag the pony&ndash;trap home next morning, with no enormous
Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a mail&ndash;cart, and they were
babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid.</p>
<p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>I cannot possibly tell you what Bill and &rsquo;Becca said when they
found that the giant had gone. For one thing, I do not know.</p>
