<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
GROWN UP</h2>
<p><strong>CYRIL</strong> had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of
occasions on which a wish would be most useful. And this thought filled his
mind when he happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after
Robert had wished to be bigger than the baker&rsquo;s boy, and had been it.
The day that lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by
getting the governess&ndash;cart home from Benenhurst.</p>
<p>Cyril dressed hastily; he did not take a bath, because tin baths are so
noisy, and he had no wish to rouse Robert, and he slipped off alone, as
Anthea had once done, and ran through the dewy morning to the
sand&ndash;pit. He dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly, and
began the conversation by asking
it whether it still felt any ill effects from the contact with the tears of
Robert the day before yesterday. The Psammead was in a good temper. It
replied politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, what can I do for you?&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;ve come here so early to ask for something for
yourself&mdash;something your brothers and sisters aren&rsquo;t to</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p194" name="194">
<p>know about, eh? Now, do be persuaded for your own good! Ask for a good fat
Megatherium and have done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;not to&ndash;day, I think,&rdquo; said Cyril
cautiously. &ldquo;What I really wanted to say was&mdash;you know how
you&rsquo;re always wishing for things when you&rsquo;re playing at
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seldom play,&rdquo; said the Psammead coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what I mean,&rdquo; Cyril went on impatiently.
&ldquo;What I want to say is: won&rsquo;t you let us have our wish
just when we think of it, and just where we happen to be? So that we
don&rsquo;t have to come and disturb you again,&rdquo; added the crafty
Cyril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only end in your wishing for something you
don&rsquo;t really want, like you did about the castle,&rdquo; said the
Psammead, stretching its brown
arms and yawning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the same since people left off
eating really wholesome things. However, have it your own way.
Good&ndash;bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&ndash;bye,&rdquo; said Cyril politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; said the Psammead suddenly,
shooting out its long snail&rsquo;s eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
tired of you&mdash;all of you. You have no more sense than so many oysters.
Go along with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Cyril went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an awful long time babies <em>stay</em> babies,&rdquo;
said Cyril after the Lamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he
wasn&rsquo;t noticing, and with coos and clucks of naughty rapture had
opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden spade, and when even
immersion in a wash&ndash;hand basin had failed to wash the mould from the
works and make the watch go again. Cyril had said several things in the
heat of the moment; but now he was calmer, and had even consented to carry
the Lamb part of the way to the woods. Cyril had persuaded the others to
agree to his plan, and not to wish for anything more till they really did
wish it. Meantime it seemed good to go
to the woods for nuts, and on the mossy grass under a sweet
chestnut&ndash;tree the five were sitting. The Lamb was pulling up the
moss by fat handfuls, and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of his
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does grow,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t oo,
precious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me grow,&rdquo; said the Lamb cheerfully&mdash;&ldquo;me grow big
boy, have guns an&rsquo;
mouses&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash; Imagination or
vocabulary gave out here. But anyway it was the longest speech the Lamb had
ever made, and it charmed everyone, even Cyril, who tumbled the Lamb over
and rolled him in the moss to the music of delighted squeals.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p196" name="196">
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll be grown up some day,&rdquo; Anthea was
saying, dreamily looking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the
long straight chestnut&ndash;leaves. But at that moment the Lamb,
struggling gaily with Cyril, thrust a stoutly&ndash;shod little foot
against his brother&rsquo;s chest; there was a crack!&mdash;the innocent
Lamb had broken the glass of father&rsquo;s second&ndash;best Waterbury
watch, which Cyril had borrowed without leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grow up some day!&rdquo; said Cyril bitterly, plumping the Lamb
down on the grass. &ldquo;I daresay he will&mdash;when nobody wants him to.
I wish to goodness he would&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh</em>, take care!&rdquo; cried Anthea in an agony of
apprehension. But it was too late&mdash;like music to a song her words and
Cyril&rsquo;s came out together&mdash;</p>
<p>Anthea&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, take care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cyril&mdash;&ldquo;Grow up now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faithful Psammead was true to its promise, and there, before the
horrified eyes of its brothers and sisters, the Lamb suddenly and violently
grew up. It was the most terrible moment. The change was not so sudden as
the wish&ndash;changes usually were. The Baby&rsquo;s face changed first.
It grew thinner and larger, lines came in the forehead, the eyes grew more
deep&ndash;set and darker in colour, the mouth grew longer and thinner;
most terrible of all, a little dark</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p197" name="197">
<p>moustache appeared on the lip of one
who was still&mdash;except as to the face&mdash;a
two&ndash;year&ndash;old baby in a linen smock and white open&ndash;work
socks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish it wouldn&rsquo;t! Oh, I wish it
wouldn&rsquo;t! You boys might wish as well!&rdquo; They all wished hard,
for the sight was enough to dismay the most heartless. They all wished so
hard, indeed, that they felt giddy and almost lost consciousness; but the
wishing was quite vain, for, when the wood ceased to whirl round, their
dazzled eyes were riveted at once by the spectacle of a very
proper&ndash;looking young man in flannels and a straw hat&mdash;a young
man who wore the same little black moustache which just before they had
actually seen growing upon the Baby&rsquo;s lip. This, then, was the
Lamb&mdash;grown up! Their own Lamb! It was a terrible moment. The
grown&ndash;up Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself
against the trunk of the sweet chestnut. He tilted the straw hat over his
eyes. He was evidently weary. He was going to sleep. The Lamb&mdash;the
original little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times and
in unexpected places. Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and the
pale green necktie like the other Lamb? or had his mind grown up together
with his body?</p>
<p>That was the question which the others, in 
a hurried council held among the yellowing bracken a few yards from the
sleeper, debated eagerly.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p198" name="198">
<p>&ldquo;Whichever it is, it&rsquo;ll be just as awful,&rdquo; said
Anthea. &ldquo;If his inside senses are grown up too, he won&rsquo;t stand
our looking after him; and if he&rsquo;s still a baby inside of him how on
earth are we to get him to do anything? And it&rsquo;ll be getting on for
dinner&ndash;time in a minute&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t got any nuts,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother nuts!&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;but dinner&rsquo;s
different&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have half enough dinner yesterday.
Couldn&rsquo;t we tie him to the tree and go home to our dinners and come
back afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fat lot of dinner we should get if we went back without the
Lamb!&rdquo; said Cyril in scornful misery. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll be just
the same if we go back with him in the state he is now. Yes, I know
it&rsquo;s my doing; don&rsquo;t rub it in! I know I&rsquo;m a beast, and
not fit to live; you can take that for settled, and say no more about it.
The question is, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wake him up, and take him into Rochester or Maidstone
and get some grub at a pastrycook&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Robert
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him?&rdquo; repeated Cyril. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;do! It&rsquo;s
all my fault&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deny that&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll find
you&rsquo;ve got your work cut out for you if you try to take that young
man anywhere. The Lamb always was spoilt, but now he&rsquo;s</p>
</div>

<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil234.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p199" name="199">
<p>grown up he&rsquo;s a demon&mdash;simply. I can see it. Look at his
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s wake him up and
see what <em>he&rsquo;ll</em> do. Perhaps <em>he&rsquo;ll</em> take
<em>us</em> to Maidstone and stand Sam. He ought to have a lot of money
in the pockets of those extra&ndash;special bags. We <em>must</em>
have dinner, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drew lots with little bits of bracken. It fell to Jane&rsquo;s lot
to waken the grown&ndash;up Lamb.</p>
<p>She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of wild honeysuckle.
He said &ldquo;Bother the flies!&rdquo; twice, and then opened his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, kiddies!&rdquo; he said in a languid tone, &ldquo;still
here? What&rsquo;s the giddy hour? You&rsquo;ll be late for your
grub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we shall,&rdquo; said Robert bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then cut along home,&rdquo; said the grown&ndash;up Lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your grub, though?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how far is it to the station, do you think? I&rsquo;ve a sort
of notion that I&rsquo;ll run up to town and have some lunch at the
club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blank misery fell like a pall on the four others. The
Lamb&mdash;alone&mdash;unattended&mdash;would go to town and have lunch at
a club! Perhaps he would also have tea there. Perhaps sunset would come
upon him amid the dazzling luxury of</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p200" name="200">
<p>club&ndash;land, and a helpless cross
sleepy baby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters, and would
wail miserably for &ldquo;Panty&rdquo; from the depths of a club
arm&ndash;chair ! The picture moved Anthea almost to tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Lamb ducky, you mustn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; she cried
incautiously.</p>
<p>The grown&ndash;up Lamb frowned. &ldquo;My dear Anthea,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;how often am I to tell you that my name is Hilary or St. Maur or
Devereux?&mdash;any of my baptismal names are
free to my little brothers and sisters, but <em>not</em>
&lsquo;Lamb&rsquo;&mdash;a relic of foolish and far&ndash;off
childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was awful. He was their elder brother now, was he? Well, of course
he was, if he was grown up&mdash;since they weren&rsquo;t. Thus, in
whispers, Anthea and Robert.</p>
<p>But the almost daily adventures resulting from the Psammead wishes were
making the children wise beyond their years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Hilary,&rdquo; said Anthea, and the others choked at the
name, &ldquo;you know father didn&rsquo;t wish you to go to London. He
wouldn&rsquo;t like us to be left alone without you to take care of us. Oh,
deceitful beast that I am!&rdquo; she added to herself.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p201" name="201">
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re our elder
brother, why not behave as such and take us over to Maidstone and give us a
jolly good blow&ndash;out, and we&rsquo;ll go on the river
afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m infinitely obliged to you,&rdquo; said the Lamb
courteously, &ldquo;but I should prefer solitude. Go home to your
lunch&mdash;I mean your dinner. Perhaps I may look in about
tea&ndash;time&mdash;or I may not be home till after you are in your
beds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their beds! Speaking glances flashed between the wretched four. Much bed
there would be for them if they went home without the Lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We promised mother not to lose sight of you if we took you
out,&rdquo; Jane said before the others could stop her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jane,&rdquo; said the grown&ndash;up Lamb, putting
his hands in his pockets and looking down at her, &ldquo;little girls
should be seen and not heard. You kids must learn not to make yourselves a
nuisance. Run along home now&mdash;and perhaps, if you&rsquo;re good,
I&rsquo;ll give you each a penny to&ndash;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, in the best &ldquo;man to
man&rdquo; tone at his command, &ldquo;where are you going, old man? You
might let Bobs and me come with you&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t want the
girls.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf239" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil239.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p202" name="202">
<p>This was really rather noble of Cyril, for he never did care much about
being seen in public with the Lamb, who of course after sunset would be a
baby again.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;man to man&rdquo; tone succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall just run over to Maidstone on my bike,&rdquo; said the
new Lamb airily, fingering the little black moustache. &ldquo;I can lunch
at The Crown&mdash;and perhaps I&rsquo;ll have a pull on the river; but I
can&rsquo;t take you all on the machine&mdash;now, can I? Run along home,
like good children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position was desperate. Robert exchanged a despairing look with
Cyril. Anthea detached a pin from her waistband, a pin whose withdrawal
left a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice, and handed it furtively to
Robert&mdash;with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning. Robert
slipped away to the road. There, sure enough, stood a bicycle&mdash;a
beautiful new free&ndash;wheel. Of course Robert understood at once that
if the Lamb was grown up he <em>must</em> have a bicycle. This had
always been one of Robert&rsquo;s own reasons for wishing to be grown up.
He hastily began to use the pin&mdash;eleven punctures in the back tyre,
seven in the front. He would have made the total twenty&ndash;two but for
the rustling of the yellow hazel&ndash;leaves, which warned him of
the approach of the others. He hastily leaned a hand on the wheel, and was
rewarded by the &ldquo;whish&rdquo; of what was left of the air escaping
from eighteen neat pin&ndash;holes.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p203" name="203">
<p>&ldquo;Your bike&rsquo;s run down,&rdquo; said Robert, wondering how he
could so soon have learned to deceive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Cyril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a puncture,&rdquo; said Anthea, stooping down, and
standing up again with a thorn which she had got ready for the purpose.
&ldquo;Look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grown&ndash;up Lamb (or Hilary, as I suppose one must now call him)
fixed his pump and blew up the tyre. The punctured state of it was soon
evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s a cottage somewhere near&mdash;where one
could get a pail of water?&rdquo; said the Lamb.</p>
<p>There was; and when the number of punctures had been made manifest, it
was felt to be a special blessing that the cottage provided &ldquo;teas for
cyclists&rdquo;. It provided an odd sort of tea&ndash;and&ndash;hammy
meal for the Lamb and his brothers. This was paid for out of
the fifteen shillings which had been earned by Robert when he was a
giant&mdash;for the Lamb, it appeared, had unfortunately no money about
him. This was a great disappointment for the others; but it is a thing that
will happen, even to the most grown&ndash;up of us. However, Robert had
enough to eat, and that was something. Quietly but persistently the
miserable four took it in turns to try to persuade the Lamb (or St. Maur)
to spend the rest of the day in the</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p204" name="204">
<p>woods. There was not very much of the
day left by the time he had mended the eighteenth puncture. He looked up
from the completed work with a sigh of relief, and suddenly put his tie
straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady coming,&rdquo; he said
briskly&mdash;&ldquo;for goodness&rsquo; sake, get out of the way. Go
home&mdash;hide&mdash;vanish somehow! I can&rsquo;t be seen with a pack of
dirty kids.&rdquo; His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty,
because, earlier in the day, the Lamb, in his infant state, had sprinkled a
good deal of garden soil over them. The grown&ndash;up Lamb&rsquo;s voice
was so tyrant&ndash;like, as Jane said afterwards, that they
actually retreated to the back garden, and left him with his little
moustache and his flannel suit to meet alone the young lady, who now came
up the front garden wheeling a bicycle.</p>
<p>The woman of the house came out, and the young lady spoke to
her&mdash;the Lamb raised his hat as she passed him&mdash;and the children
could not hear what she said, though they were craning round the corner by
the pig&ndash;pail and listening with all their ears. They felt it to be
&ldquo;perfectly fair,&rdquo; as Robert said, &ldquo;with that wretched
Lamb in that condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Lamb spoke, in a languid voice heavy with politeness, they
heard well enough.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf240" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil240.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p205" name="205">
<p>&ldquo;A puncture?&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Can I not be of any
assistance? If you could allow me&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stifled explosion of laughter behind the
pig&ndash;pail&mdash;the grown&ndash;up Lamb (otherwise Devereux) turned
the tail of an angry eye in its direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rdquo; said the lady, looking at the
Lamb. She looked rather shy, but, as
the boys put it, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any nonsense about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh,&rdquo; whispered Cyril behind the pig&ndash;pail,
&ldquo;I should have thought he&rsquo;d had enough bicycle&ndash;mending
for one day&mdash; and if she only knew that really and truly he&rsquo;s
only a whiny&ndash;piny, silly little baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <em>not</em>,&rdquo; Anthea murmured angrily.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dear&mdash;if people only let him alone. It&rsquo;s our
own precious Lamb still, whatever silly idiots may turn him
into&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he, Pussy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane doubtfully supposed so.</p>
<p>Now, the Lamb&mdash;whom I must try to remember to call St.
Maur&mdash;was examining the lady&rsquo;s bicycle and talking to her with a
very grown&ndash;up manner indeed. No one could possibly have supposed, to
see and hear him, that only that very morning he had been a chubby child of
two years breaking other people&rsquo;s Waterbury watches. Devereux (as he
ought to be called for the future) took</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p206" name="206">
<p>out a gold watch when he had mended
the lady&rsquo;s bicycle, and all the onlookers behind the pig&ndash;pail
said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash; because it seemed so unfair that the Baby, who had only that morning destroyed two cheap but
honest watches, should now, in the grown&ndash;upness Cyril&rsquo;s folly
had raised him to, have a real gold watch&mdash;with a chain and seals!</p>
<p>Hilary (as I will now term him) withered his brothers and sisters with a
glance, and then said to the lady&mdash;with whom he seemed to be quite
friendly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will allow me, I will ride with you as far as the Cross
Roads; it is getting late, and there are tramps about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one will ever know what answer the young lady intended to give to
this gallant offer, for, directly Anthea heard it made, she rushed out,
knocking against the pig&ndash;pail, which overflowed in a turbid stream,
and caught the Lamb (I suppose I ought to say Hilary) by the arm. The
others followed, and in an instant the four dirty children were visible,
beyond disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him,&rdquo; said Anthea to the lady, and she
spoke with intense earnestness; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not fit to go with
anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, little girl!&rdquo; said St. Maur (as
we will now call him) in a terrible voice. &ldquo;Go home at
once!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p207" name="207">
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d much better not have anything to do with him,&rdquo;
the now reckless Anthea went on. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know who he is.
He&rsquo;s something very different from what you think he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the lady not unnaturally, while
Devereux (as I must term the grown&ndash;up Lamb) tried vainly to push
Anthea away. The others backed her up, and she stood solid as a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just let him go with you,&rdquo; said Anthea,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll soon see what I mean! How would you like to suddenly
see a poor little helpless baby spinning along downhill beside you with its
feet up on a bicycle it had lost control of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady had turned rather pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these very dirty children?&rdquo; she asked the
grown&ndash;up Lamb (sometimes called St. Maur in these pages).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he lied miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lamb! how <em>can</em> you?&rdquo; cried
Jane,&mdash;&ldquo;when you know perfectly well you&rsquo;re our
own little baby brother that we&rsquo;re so fond of. We&rsquo;re his big
brothers and sisters,&rdquo; she explained, turning to the lady, who with
trembling hands was now turning her bicycle towards the gate, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ve got to take care of him. And we must get him home</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p208" name="208">
<p>before sunset, or I don&rsquo;t know whatever will become of us. You see,
he&rsquo;s sort of under a spell&mdash;enchanted&mdash;you know what I
mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again and again the Lamb (Devereux, I mean) had tried to stop
Jane&rsquo;s eloquence, but Robert and Cyril held him, one by each leg, and
no proper explanation was possible. The lady rode hastily away, and
electrified her relatives at dinner by telling them of her escape from a
family of dangerous lunatics. &ldquo;The little girl&rsquo;s eyes were
simply those of a maniac. I can&rsquo;t think how she came to be at
large,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>When her bicycle had whizzed away down the road, Cyril spoke
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilary, old chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must have had a
sunstroke or something. And the things you&rsquo;ve been saying to that
lady! Why, if we were to tell you the things you&rsquo;ve said
when you are yourself again, say to&ndash;morrow morning, you
wouldn&rsquo;t even understand them&mdash;let alone believe them! You trust
to me, old chap, and come home, now, and if you&rsquo;re not yourself in
the morning we&rsquo;ll ask the milkman to ask the doctor to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor grown&ndash;up Lamb (St. Maur was really one of his Christian
names) seemed now too bewildered to resist.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf245" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil245.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p209" name="209">
<p>&ldquo;Since you seem all to be as mad as the whole worshipful company
of hatters,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;I suppose I <em>had</em>
better take you home. But you&rsquo;re not to suppose I shall pass this
over. I shall have something to say to you all to&ndash;morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will, my Lamb,&rdquo; said Anthea under her breath,
&ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t be at all the sort of thing you think it&rsquo;s
going to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her heart she could hear the pretty, soft little loving voice of the
baby Lamb&mdash;so different from the affected tones of the dreadful
grown&ndash;up Lamb (one of whose names were Devereux)&mdash;saying,
&ldquo;Me love Panty&mdash;wants to come to own Panty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get home, for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;You shall say whatever you like in the morning&mdash;if you
can,&rdquo; she added in a whisper.</p>
<p>It was a gloomy party that went home through the soft evening. During
Anthea&rsquo;s remarks Robert had again made play with the pin and the
bicycle tyre and the Lamb (whom they had to call St. Maur or Devereux or
Hilary) seemed really at last to have had his fill of
bicycle&ndash;mending. So the machine was wheeled.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p210" name="210">
<p>The sun was just on the point of setting when they arrived at the White
House. The four elder children would have liked to linger in the lane till
the complete sunsetting turned the grown&ndash;up Lamb (whose Christian
names I will not further weary you by repeating) into their own dear
tiresome baby brother. But he, in his grow&ndash;upness, insisted on going
on, and thus he was met in the front garden by Martha.</p>
<p>Now you remember that, as a special favour, the Psammead had arranged
that the servants in the house should never notice any change brought about
by the wishes of the children. Therefore Martha merely saw the usual
party, with the baby Lamb, about whom she had been desperately anxious all
the afternoon, trotting beside Anthea on fat baby legs, while the children,
of course, still saw the grown&ndash;up Lamb (never mind what names he was
christened by), and Martha rushed at him and caught him in her arms,
exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to his own Martha, then&mdash;a precious poppet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grown&ndash;up Lamb (whose names shall now be buried in oblivion)
struggled furiously. An expression of intense horror and annoyance was seen
on his face. But Martha was stronger than he. She lifted him up and carried
him into the house. None of the children will ever forget that picture. The
neat grey&ndash;flannel&ndash;suited grown&ndash;up young</p>

him away helpless, imploring him, as she went, to be a good boy now, and
come and have his nice bremmink! Fortunately, the sun set as they reached
the doorstep, the bicycle disappeared, and Martha was seen to carry into
the house the real live darling sleepy two&ndash;year&ndash;old Lamb. The
grown&ndash;up Lamb (nameless henceforth) was gone for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;because, as soon as ever the
Lamb&rsquo;s old enough to be bullied, we must jolly well begin to bully
him, for his own sake&mdash;so that he mayn&rsquo;t grow up like
<em>that</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t bully him,&rdquo; said Anthea
stoutly,&mdash;&ldquo;not if I can stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must tame him by kindness,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;if he grows up in the usual
way, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of time to correct him as he goes along. The
awful thing to&ndash;day was his growing up so suddenly. There was no time
to improve him at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want any improving,&rdquo; said Anthea as the
voice of the Lamb came coming through the open door, just as she had heard
it in her heart that afternoon&mdash;</p>
