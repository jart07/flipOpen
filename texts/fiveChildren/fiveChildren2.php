<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
GOLDEN GUINEAS</h2>
<p><strong>ANTHEA</strong> woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in
which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day
without any umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the
rain, and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and
the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular
breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep.
The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea&rsquo;s face from the wet corner
of a bath&ndash;towel which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the
water out of, to wake her up, as he now explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, drop it!&rdquo; she said rather crossly; so he did, for he
was not a brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple&ndash;pie beds,
booby&ndash;traps,
original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other little
accomplishments which made home happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had such a funny dream,&rdquo; Anthea began.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p31" name="31">
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Jane, wakening suddenly and without
warning. &ldquo;I dreamed we found a Sand&ndash;fairy in the
gravel&ndash;pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd, and we might have a new
wish every day, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what <em>I</em> dreamed,&rdquo; said Robert;
&ldquo;I was just going to tell you&mdash;and we had the first wish
directly it said so. And I dreamed you girls were donkeys enough to ask for
us all to be beautiful as the day, and we jolly well were, and it was
perfectly beastly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <em>can</em> different people all dream the same
thing?&rdquo; said Anthea, sitting up in bed, &ldquo;because I dreamed all
that as well as about the Zoo and the rain; and Baby didn&rsquo;t know us
in my dream, and the servants shut us out of the house because the
radiantness of our beauty was such a complete disguise,
and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Robert,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be late for
breakfast again&mdash;unless you mean to shirk your bath like you did on
Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, come here a sec,&rdquo; Robert replied. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t shirk it; I had it after brekker in father&rsquo;s
dressing&ndash;room, because ours was emptied away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p32" name="32">
<p>Cyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve all had such an
odd dream. We&rsquo;ve all dreamed we found a Sand&ndash;fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice died away before Cyril&rsquo;s contemptuous glance.
&ldquo;Dream?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you little sillies, it&rsquo;s
<em>true</em>. I tell you it all happened. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
so keen on being down early. We&rsquo;ll go up there directly after
brekker, and have another wish. Only we&rsquo;ll make up our minds, solid,
before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask for anything
unless the others agree first. No more peerless beauties for this child,
thank you. Not if I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about
the Sand&ndash;fairy
was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream, the girls thought.
Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not sure, till after they
had seen Martha and heard her full and plain reminders about their naughty
conduct the day before. Then Anthea was sure. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;servants never dream anything but the things in the
Dream&ndash;book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding&mdash;
that means a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are
babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking of babies,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the
Lamb?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p33" name="33">
<p>&ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins.
Mother said she might. She&rsquo;s dressing him now,&rdquo; said Jane,
&ldquo;in his very best coat and hat. Bread&ndash;and&ndash;butter,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to like taking him too,&rdquo; said Robert in a tone of
wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Servants <em>do</em> like taking babies to see their
relations,&rdquo; Cyril said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed it
before&mdash;especially in their best things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect they pretend they&rsquo;re their own babies, and that
they&rsquo;re not servants at all, but
married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say the babies are the
little dukes and duchesses,&rdquo; Jane suggested dreamily, taking more
marmalade. &ldquo;I expect that&rsquo;s what Martha&rsquo;ll say to her
cousin. She&rsquo;ll enjoy herself most frightfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our
infant duke to Rochester,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;not if she&rsquo;s
anything like me&mdash;she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back! Oh,
crikey!&rdquo; said Cyril in full agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going by carrier,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see them off, then we shall have done a polite and
kindly act, and we shall be quite sure we&rsquo;ve got rid of them for the
day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p34" name="34">
<p>So they did.</p>
<p>Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the
chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink cornflowers
and white ribbon. She had a yellow&ndash;lace collar with a green bow. And
the Lamb had indeed his very best cream&ndash;coloured silk coat and hat.
It was a smart party that the
carrier&rsquo;s cart picked up at the Cross Roads. When its white tilt and
red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl of chalkdust&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for the Sammyadd!&rdquo; said Cyril, and off they
went.</p>
<p>As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for. Although they
were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of the
gravel&ndash;pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had
been carts. They had made a ring of stones round the place where the
Sand&ndash;fairy had disappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun
was burning and bright, and the sky was deep blue&mdash;without a cloud.
The sand was very hot to touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;suppose it was only a dream, after all,&rdquo; Robert
said as the boys uncovered their spades from the sand&ndash;heap where
they had buried them and began to dig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you were a sensible chap,&rdquo; said Cyril;
&ldquo;one&rsquo;s quite as likely as the other!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p35" name="35">
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head,&rdquo; Robert
snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we girls take a turn,&rdquo; said Jane,
laughing. &ldquo;You boys seem to be getting very warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you don&rsquo;t come shoving your silly oar in,&rdquo;
said Robert, who was now warm indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anthea quickly. &ldquo;Robert dear,
don&rsquo;t be so grumpy&mdash;we won&rsquo;t say a word, you shall be the
one to speak to the Fairy and tell him what we&rsquo;ve decided to wish
for. You&rsquo;ll say it much better than we shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you drop being a little humbug,&rdquo; said Robert, but
not crossly. &ldquo;Look out&mdash;dig with your hands, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they did, and presently uncovered the spider&ndash;shaped brown
hairy body, long arms and legs, bat&rsquo;s ear and snail&rsquo;s eyes of
the Sand&ndash;fairy himself. Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction,
for now of course it couldn&rsquo;t have been a dream.</p>
<p>The Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your left whisker this morning?&rdquo; said Anthea
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to boast of,&rdquo; said it; &ldquo;it had rather a
restless night. But thank you for asking.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p36" name="36">
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;do you feel up to giving wishes
to&ndash;day, because we very much want an extra besides the regular one?
The extra&rsquo;s a very little one,&rdquo; he added reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the Sand&ndash;fairy. (If you read this story
aloud, please pronounce &ldquo;humph&rdquo; exactly as it is spelt, for
that is how he said it.) &ldquo;Humph! Do you know, until I heard you being
disagreeable to each other just over my head, and so loud too, I really
quite thought I had dreamed you all. I do have very odd dreams
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Jane hurried to say, so as to get away from the
subject of disagreeableness. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she added politely,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d tell us about your dreams&mdash;they must be awfully
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the day&rsquo;s wish?&rdquo; said the Sand&ndash;fairy,
yawning.</p>
<p>Cyril muttered something about &ldquo;just like a girl,&rdquo; and the
rest stood silent. If they said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; then good&ndash;bye to
the other wishes they had decided to ask for. If they said
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; it would be very rude, and they had all been
taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not at all the same
thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the Sand&ndash;fairy
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do I shan&rsquo;t have strength to give you a second wish;
not even good tempers, or common sense, or manners, or little things like
that.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p37" name="37">
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to put yourself out at all about
<em>these</em> things, we can manage them quite well ourselves,&rdquo;
said Cyril eagerly; while the others looked guiltily at each other, and
wished the Fairy would not keep all on about good tempers, but give them
one good rowing if it wanted to, and then have done with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Psammead, putting out his long
snail&rsquo;s eyes so suddenly that one of them nearly went into the round
boy&rsquo;s eye of Robert, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the little wish
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the servants to notice the gifts you give
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are kind enough to give us,&rdquo; said Anthea in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are kind enough to give us, I mean,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>The Fairy swelled himself out a bit, let his breath go, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done <em>that</em> for you&mdash;it was quite
easy. People don&rsquo;t notice things much, anyway. What&rsquo;s the next
wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want,&rdquo; said Robert slowly, &ldquo;to be rich beyond the
dreams of something or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avarice,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p38" name="38">
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said the Fairy unexpectedly. &ldquo;But it
won&rsquo;t do you much good, that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; it muttered
to itself. &ldquo;Come &mdash;I can&rsquo;t go beyond dreams, you know! How
much do you want, and will you have it in gold or notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, please&mdash;and millions of it.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gravel&ndash;pit full be enough?&rdquo; said the Fairy in
an offhand manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh <em>yes</em>!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get out before I begin, or you&rsquo;ll be buried alive in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that
the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts used
to come to the gravel&ndash;pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough
to
shout a timid &ldquo;Good&ndash;morning, I hope your whisker will be
better to&ndash;morrow,&rdquo; as she ran.</p>
<p>On the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their
eyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the sight
was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear it. It was something
like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day. For the whole
of the sand&ndash;pit was full, right up to the very top,</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p39" name="39"><p>with new shining
gold pieces, and all the little sand&ndash;martins&rsquo; little front
doors were covered out of sight. Where the road for the carts wound into
the gravel&ndash;pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the
roadside, and a great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay
flat and smooth between the tall sides of the gravel&ndash;pit. And all
the gleaming heap was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these
countless coins the midday sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed
till the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the
fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset.</p>
<p>The children stood with their mouths open, and no one said a word.</p>
<p>At last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the
edge of the heap by the cart&ndash;road, and looked at it. He looked on
both sides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold, anyway,&rdquo; said Cyril. And now they all
began to talk at once. They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls
and let it run through their fingers like water, and the chink it made as
it fell was wonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of
spending the money, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf45" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil045.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p40" name="40"><p>
heaps of gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in
sand when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with
his newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she cried
out, &ldquo;Oh, stop, it&rsquo;s too heavy! It hurts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert said &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out, I tell you,&rdquo; cried Jane, and was taken out,
very white, and trembling a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea what it&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like stones on you&mdash;or like chains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Cyril said, &ldquo;if this is to do us any
good, it&rsquo;s no good our staying gasping at it like this. Let&rsquo;s
fill our pockets and go and buy things. Don&rsquo;t you forget, it
won&rsquo;t last after sunset. I wish we&rsquo;d asked the Sammyadd why
things don&rsquo;t turn to stone. Perhaps this will. I&rsquo;ll tell you
what, there&rsquo;s a pony and cart in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to buy that?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, silly,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll <em>hire</em> it. And then
we&rsquo;ll go to Rochester and buy heaps and heaps of things. Look here,
let&rsquo;s each take as much as we can carry. But it&rsquo;s not
sovereigns. They&rsquo;ve got a man&rsquo;s head on one side and a thing
like the ace of spades on the other. Fill your pockets with it, I tell you,
and come along. You can jaw as we go&mdash;if you <em>must</em>
jaw.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p41" name="41">
<p>Cyril sat down and began to fill his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my
Norfolks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but now you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did. For when Cyril had filled his
nine pockets and his handkerchief and the space between himself and his
shirt front with the gold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and
had to sit down again in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw out some of the cargo,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sink the ship, old chap. That comes of nine
pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Cyril had to.</p>
<p>Then they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and
the road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and
hotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier.</p>
<p>It was Jane who said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re to spend
it all. There must be thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I&rsquo;m
going to leave some of mine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we
get to the village we&rsquo;ll buy some biscuits; I know it&rsquo;s long
past dinner&ndash;time.&rdquo; She took out a handful or two of gold and
hid it in the hollows of an old hornbeam. &ldquo;How round and yellow they
are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish they were gingerbread
nuts and we were going to eat them?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p42" name="42">
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re not, and we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village,
more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden
treasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas in
their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked quite
ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have more than a
half&ndash;crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue of the
wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of the
village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench they came to. It
happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn.</p>
<p>It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for
ginger&ndash;beer, because, as Anthea said, &ldquo;It is not wrong for men
to go into public houses, only for children. And Cyril is nearer to being a
man than us, because he is the eldest.&rdquo; So he went. The others sat in
the sun and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hats, how hot it is!&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Dogs put
their tongues out when they&rsquo;re hot; I
wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try,&rdquo; Jane said; and they all put their tongues
out as far as ever they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats,
but it only seemed to make them thirstier</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p43" name="43">
<p>than ever, besides annoying
everyone who went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril
came back with the ginger&ndash;beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to pay for it out of my own
two&ndash;and&ndash;sevenpence, though, that I was going to buy rabbits
with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t change the gold. And when
I pulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was
card&ndash;counters. And I got some sponge&ndash;cakes too, out of a
glass jar on the bar&ndash;counter. And some biscuits with caraways
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sponge&ndash;cakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry
too, and yet soft, which biscuits ought not to be. But the
ginger&ndash;beer made up for everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn now to try to buy something with the
money,&rdquo; Anthea said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m next eldest. Where is the
pony&ndash;cart kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at The Chequers, and Anthea went
in the back way to the yard, because they all knew that little girls ought
not to go into the bars of public&ndash;houses. She came out, as she
herself said, &ldquo;pleased but not proud&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be ready in a brace of shakes, he says,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s to have one sovereign&mdash;or whatever it
is&mdash;to drive us in to Rochester and back, besides waiting there till
we&rsquo;ve got everything we want. I think I managed very well.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf48" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil048.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p44" name="44">
<p>&ldquo;You think yourself jolly clever, I daresay,&rdquo; said Cyril
moodily. &ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money
out of my pocket, to make it seem cheap, anyway,&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;I just found a young man doing something to a horse&rsquo;s leg with
a sponge and a pail. And I held out one sovereign, and I said, &lsquo;Do
you know what this is?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;d
call his father. And the old man came, and he said it was a spade guinea;
and he said was it my own to do as I liked with, and I said
&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;; and I asked about the pony&ndash;cart, and I said he
could have the guinea if he&rsquo;d
drive us in to Rochester. And his name is S. Crispin. And he said,
&lsquo;Right oh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a new sensation to be driven in a smart pony&ndash;trap along
pretty country roads; it was very pleasant too (which is not always the
case with new sensations), quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending
the money which each child made as they went along, silently of course and
quite to itself, for they felt it would never have done to let the old
innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way they were thinking in.
The old man put them down by the bridge at their request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were going to buy a carriage and horses, where would you
go?&rdquo; asked Cyril, as if he were only asking for the sake of something
to say.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p45" name="45">
<p>&ldquo;Billy Peasemarsh, at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; said the
old man promptly. &ldquo;Though all forbid I should recommend any man where
it&rsquo;s a question of horses, no more than I&rsquo;d take anybody
else&rsquo;s recommending if I was a&ndash;buying one. But if your
pa&rsquo;s thinking of a turnout of any sort, there ain&rsquo;t a
straighter
man in Rochester, nor a civiller spoken, than Billy, though I says
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;The Saracen&rsquo;s
Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside
down and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown&ndash;up person
would tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy
money had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was
almost impossible. The tradespeople of Rochester seemed to shrink, to a
trades&ndash;person, from the glittering fairy gold (&ldquo;furrin
money&rdquo; they called it, for the most part). To begin with, Anthea, who
had had the misfortune to sit on her hat earlier in the day, wished to buy
another. She chose a very beautiful one, trimmed with pink roses and the
blue breasts of peacocks. It was marked in the window, &ldquo;Paris Model,
three guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because, if it says
guineas, it means guineas, and not sovereigns, which we haven&rsquo;t
got.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf50" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil050.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p46" name="46">
<p>But when she took three of the spade
guineas in her hand, which was by this time rather dirty owing to her not
having put on gloves before going to the gravel&ndash;pit, the
black&ndash;silk young lady in the shop looked very hard at her, and went
and whispered something to an older and uglier lady, also in black silk,
and then they gave her back the money and said it was not current coin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good money,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not the
kind of money that&rsquo;s fashionable now, and we don&rsquo;t care about
taking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they think we&rsquo;ve stolen it,&rdquo; said Anthea,
rejoining the others in the street; &ldquo;if we had gloves they
wouldn&rsquo;t think we were so dishonest. It&rsquo;s my hands being so
dirty fills their minds with doubts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the
kind at sixpence three&ndash;farthings, but when they offered a guinea the
woman looked at it through her spectacles and said she had no change; so
the gloves had to be paid for out of Cyril&rsquo;s
two&ndash;and&ndash;sevenpence that he meant to buy rabbits with,
and so had the green imitation crocodile&ndash;skin purse at
ninepence&ndash;halfpenny which had been bought at the same time. They
tried several more shops, the kinds where you buy toys and scent, and silk</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p47" name="47">
<p>
handkerchiefs and books, and fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of
objects of interest in the vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea
that day in Rochester, and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier
and dirtier, and their hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and
fell down on a part of the road where a water&ndash;cart had just gone by.
Also they got very hungry, but they found no one would give them anything
to eat for their guineas. After trying two pastry&ndash;cooks in vain,
they became so hungry, perhaps from the smell of the cake in the shops, as
Cyril suggested, that they formed a plan of campaign in whispers and
carried it out in desperation. They marched into a third
pastry&ndash;cook&rsquo;s&mdash;Beale his name was,&mdash;and before the
people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized three new
penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty hands, and taken a
big bite
out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood at bay, with the twelve buns in
their hands and their mouths very full indeed. The shocked
pastry&ndash;cook bounded round the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Cyril, speaking as distinctly as he could, and
holding out the guinea he got ready before entering the shop, &ldquo;pay
yourself out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it into his pocket.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p48" name="48">
<p>&ldquo;Off you go,&rdquo; he said, brief and stern like the man in the
song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the change?&rdquo; said Anthea, who had a saving mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change you! Hout
you goes; and you may think yourselves lucky I don&rsquo;t send for the
police to find out where you got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Castle Gardens the millionaires finished the buns, and though the
curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a charm in
raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart quailed at
the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the
Saracen&rsquo;s Head on the subject of a horse and
carriage. The boys would have given up the idea, but Jane was always a
hopeful child, and Anthea generally an obstinate one, and their earnestness
prevailed.</p>
<p>The whole party, by this time indescribably dirty, therefore betook
itself to the Saracen&rsquo;s Head. The yard&ndash;method of attack having
been successful at The Chequers was tried again here. Mr. Peasemarsh was in
the yard, and Robert opened the business in these terms&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to
sell.&rdquo; It had been agreed that Robert should be spokesman, because in
books it is always the gentlemen who buy horses, and not ladies, and Cyril
had had his go at the Blue Boar.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p49" name="49">
<p>&ldquo;They tell you true, young man,&rdquo; said Mr. Peasemarsh. He was
a long lean man, with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should like to buy some, please,&rdquo; said Robert
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show us a few, please? To choose from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you a&ndash;kidden of?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Billy
Peasemarsh. &ldquo;Was you sent here of a message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;we want to buy some horses
and carriages, and a man told us you were straight and civil spoken, but I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he was mistaken.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my sacred!&rdquo; said Mr. Peasemarsh. &ldquo;Shall I trot
the whole stable out for your Honour&rsquo;s worship to see? Or shall I
send round to the Bishop&rsquo;s to see of he&rsquo;s a nag or two to
dispose of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s not too much
trouble. It would be very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed, and they did
not like the way he did it. Then he shouted &ldquo;Willum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stooping ostler appeared in a stable door.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p50" name="50">
<p>&ldquo;Here, Willum, come and look at this &rsquo;ere young dook! Wants
to buy the whole stud, lock, stock, and bar&rsquo;l. And ain&rsquo;t got
tuppence in his pocket to bless hisself with, I&rsquo;ll go
bail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willum&rsquo;s eyes followed his master&rsquo;s pointing thumb with
contemptuous interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do &rsquo;e, for sure?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But Robert spoke, though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket
and begging him to &ldquo;come along&rdquo;. He spoke, and he was very
angry; he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a young duke, and I never pretended to be. And as
for tuppence&mdash;what do you call this?&rdquo; And before the others
could stop him he had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas, and
held them out for Mr. Peasemarsh to look at. He did look. He snatched one
up in his finger and thumb. He bit it, and Jane expected him to say,
&ldquo;The best horse in my stables is at your service.&rdquo; But the
others knew better. Still it was a blow, even to the most desponding, when
he said shortly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willum, shut the yard doors,&rdquo; and Willum grinned and went
to shut them.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p51" name="51">
<p>&ldquo;Good&ndash;afternoon,&rdquo; said Robert hastily; &ldquo;we
shan&rsquo;t buy any of your horses now, whatever you say, and I hope
it&rsquo;ll be a lesson to you.&rdquo; He had seen a little side gate open,
and was moving towards it as he spoke. But Billy Peasemarsh put himself in
the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, you young off&ndash;scouring!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Willum, fetch the pleece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willum went. The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep,
and Mr. Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived. He said many
things. Among other things he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice lot you are, aren&rsquo;t you, coming tempting honest men
with your guineas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <em>are</em> guineas,&rdquo; said Cyril boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course we don&rsquo;t know all about that, no more we
don&rsquo;t&mdash;oh no&mdash;course not! And dragging little gells into it
too. &rsquo;Ere&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let the gells go if you&rsquo;ll come
along to the pleece quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be let go,&rdquo; said Jane heroically; &ldquo;not
without the boys. It&rsquo;s our money just as much as theirs, you wicked
old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get it, then?&rdquo; said the man, softening
slightly, which was not at all what the boys expected when Jane began to
call names.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf56" name="">
<img src="illustrations/fiveChildren/nesbit-fivechil056.jpg" alt="Five Children and It Illustrations" />
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p52" name="52">
<p>Jane cast a silent glance of agony at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost your tongue, eh? Got it fast enough
when it&rsquo;s for calling names with. Come, speak up. Where&rsquo;d you
get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the gravel&ndash;pit,&rdquo; said truthful Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next article,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you we did,&rdquo; Jane said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fairy
there&mdash;all over brown fur&mdash;with ears like a bat&rsquo;s and eyes
like a snail&rsquo;s, and he gives you a wish a day, and they all come
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touched in the head, eh?&rdquo; said the man in a low voice,
&ldquo;all the more shame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child
into your sinful burglaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not mad; it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Anthea;
&ldquo;there <em>is</em> a fairy. If I ever see him again I&rsquo;ll
wish for something for you; at least I would if vengeance wasn&rsquo;t
wicked&mdash;so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; lumme,&rdquo; said Billy Peasemarsh, &ldquo;if there
ain&rsquo;t another on &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Willum came back, with a spiteful grin on his face, and at his
back a policeman, with whom Mr. Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse earnest
whisper.</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p53" name="53">
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said the policeman at last.
&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em up on a charge of unlawful
possession, pending inquiries. And
the magistrate will deal with the case. Send the afflicted ones to a home,
as likely as not, and the boys to a reformatory. Now then, come along,
youngsters! No use making a fuss. You bring the gells along, Mr.
Peasemarsh, sir, and I&rsquo;ll shepherd the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speechless with rage and horror, the four children were driven along the
streets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them, so that when
Robert ran right into a passer&ndash;by he did not recognise her till a
well&ndash;known voice said, &ldquo;Well, if ever I did. Oh, Master
Robert, whatever have you been a&ndash;doing of now?&rdquo; And another
voice, quite as well known, said, &ldquo;Panty; want go own
Panty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had run into Martha and the baby!</p>
<p>Martha behaved admirably. She refused to believe a word of the
policeman&rsquo;s story, or of Mr. Peasemarsh&rsquo;s either, even when
they made Robert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the
guineas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
gone out of your senses, you two! There ain&rsquo;t any gold
there&mdash;only the poor child&rsquo;s
hands, all over crock and dirt, and like the very chimbley. Oh, that I
should ever see the day!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p54" name="54">
<p>And the children thought this very noble of Martha, even if rather
wicked, till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the servants
should never notice any of the fairy gifts. So of course Martha
couldn&rsquo;t see the gold, and so was only speaking the truth, and that
was quite right, of course, but not extra noble.</p>
<p>It was getting dusk when they reached the police&ndash;station. The
policeman told his tale to an inspector, who sat in a large bare room with
a thing like a clumsy nursery&ndash;fender at one end to put prisoners in.
Robert wondered whether it was a cell or a dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Produce the coins, officer,&rdquo; said the inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn out your pockets,&rdquo; said the constable.</p>
<p>Cyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets, stood still a
moment, and then began to laugh&mdash;an odd sort of laugh that hurt, and
that felt much more like crying. His pockets were empty. So were the
pockets of the
others. For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had vanished away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn out your pockets, and stop that noise,&rdquo; said the
inspector.</p>
<p>Cyril turned out his pockets, every one of the nine which enriched his
Norfolk suit. And every pocket was empty.</p>
</div>


<div class="bookPage" id="pf62" name="">

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p55" name="55">
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they done it&mdash;artful little beggars!
They walked in front of me the &rsquo;ole way, so as for me to keep my eye
on them and not to attract a crowd and obstruct the traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very remarkable,&rdquo; said the inspector,
frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve quite done a&ndash;browbeating of the innocent
children,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hire a private carriage and
we&rsquo;ll drive home to their papa&rsquo;s mansion. You&rsquo;ll hear
about this again young man!&mdash;I told you they hadn&rsquo;t got any
gold, when you were pretending to see it in their poor helpless hands.
It&rsquo;s early in the day for a constable on duty not to be able to trust
his own eyes. As to the other one, the less said the better; he keeps the
Saracen&rsquo;s
Head, and he knows best what his liquor&rsquo;s like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them away, for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; said the
inspector crossly. But as they left the police&ndash;station he said,
&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh, and he said it
twenty times as crossly as he had spoken to Martha.</p>

</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p56" name="56">
<p>Martha was as good as her word. She took them home in a very grand
carriage, because the carrier&rsquo;s cart was gone, and, though she had
stood by them so nobly with the police, she was so angry with them as soon
as they were alone for &ldquo;trapseing into Rochester by
themselves,&rdquo; that none of them dared to mention the old man with the
pony&ndash;cart from the village who was waiting for them in Rochester.
And so, after one day of boundless wealth, the children found themselves
sent to bed in deep disgrace, and only enriched by two pairs of cotton
gloves, dirty inside because of the state of the hands they had been put on
to cover, an imitation crocodile&ndash;skin purse, and twelve penny buns,
long since digested.</p>
<p>The thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old
gentleman&rsquo;s guinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the
rest, so they went down to the village next day to apologise for not
meeting him in Rochester, and to <em>see</em>. They found him very
friendly. The guinea had <em>not</em> disappeared, and he had bored a
hole in it and hung it on his watch&ndash;chain. As for the guinea the
baker took, the children felt they <em>could</em> not care whether it
had vanished or not, which was not perhaps very honest, but on the other
hand was not wholly unnatural. But afterwards this preyed on Anthea&rsquo;s
mind, and at last she secretly sent twelve stamps by post to &ldquo;Mr.
Beale, Baker, Rochester.&rdquo; Inside she wrote, &ldquo;To pay for the
buns.&rdquo; I hope the</p>
</div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p57" name="57">
<p>guinea did disappear, for that pastry&ndash;cook
was really not at all a nice man, and, besides, penny buns are seven for
sixpence in all really respectable shops.</p>
