<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id00011>THE INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P id=id00012>THE Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the 
exception of the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer 
approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the 
Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the State are 
more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the Symposium and the 
Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other Dialogue of Plato has the same 
largeness of view and the same perfection of style; no other shows an equal 
knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well 
as old, and not of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper 
irony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in 
any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and 
speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre 
around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the 
highest point to which ancient thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, 
like Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, 
although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the 
substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of 
science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom 
the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the 
germs of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, 
which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon 
the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of 
contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the 
essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between 
causes and conditions; also the division of the mind into the rational, 
concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary 
and unnecessary—these and other great forms of thought are all of them to be 
found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato. The greatest 
of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt 
to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most 
strenuously insisted on by him, although he has not always avoided the confusion 
of them in his own writings. But he does not bind up truth in logical 
formulae,—logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he 
imagines to "contemplate all truth and all existence" is very unlike the 
doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered.</P>
<P id=id00013>Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of 
a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of Athens, as 
well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of the Critias has 
given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance to the tale of 
Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as a fact to have inspired some of 
the early navigators of the sixteenth century. This mythical tale, of which the 
subject was a history of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of 
Atlantis, is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which 
it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to 
the poems of Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty, intended to 
represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the noble 
commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias itself, and from 
the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would have treated this high 
argument. We can only guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because 
Plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he 
had lost his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion 
of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary 
narrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathizing 
with the struggle for Hellenic independence, singing a hymn of triumph over 
Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus where he 
contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire—"How brave a thing is freedom of 
speech, which has made the Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas 
in greatness!" or, more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good 
order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene.</P>
<P id=id00014>Again, Plato may be regarded as the "captain" ('arhchegoz') or 
leader of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the 
original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God, of the Utopia 
of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary States which are framed 
upon the same model. The extent to which Aristotle or the Aristotelian school 
were indebted to him in the Politics has been little recognized, and the 
recognition is the more necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. 
The two philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and 
probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In English 
philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works of the 
Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, 
to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth higher than experience, of which 
the mind bears witness to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation 
has been enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek 
authors who at the Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had 
the greatest influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon 
education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and 
Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation 
of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the unity of 
knowledge; in the early Church he exercised a real influence on theology, and at 
the Revival of Literature on politics. Even the fragments of his words when 
"repeated at second-hand" have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have 
seen reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of idealism in 
philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many of the latest conceptions of 
modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of knowledge, the reign of law, 
and the equality of the sexes, have been anticipated in a dream by him.</P>
<H3 style="MARGIN-TOP: 3em" id=id00015>ARGUMENT</H3>
<P id=id00016>The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the 
nature of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old 
man—then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and 
Polemarchus—then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by 
Socrates—reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and having become 
invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal State which is 
constructed by Socrates. The first care of the rulers is to be education, of 
which an outline is drawn after the old Hellenic model, providing only for an 
improved religion and morality, and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a 
manlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the individual and the State. 
We are thus led on to the conception of a higher State, in which "no man calls 
anything his own," and in which there is neither "marrying nor giving in 
marriage," and "kings are philosophers" and "philosophers are kings;" and there 
is another and higher education, intellectual as well as moral and religious, of 
science as well as of art, and not of youth only but of the whole of life. Such 
a State is hardly to be realized in this world and would quickly degenerate. To 
the perfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honor, 
this again declining into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary 
but regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When "the 
wheel has come full circle" we do not begin again with a new period of human 
life; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. The 
subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had 
been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed 
and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice 
removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been 
condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along with them. And the idea 
of the State is supplemented by the revelation of a future life.</P>
<P id=id00017>The division into books, like all similar divisions, is probably 
later than the age of Plato. The natural divisions are five in number;—(1) Book 
I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, "I had always 
admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus," which is introductory; the first 
book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice, 
and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without arriving at any 
definite result. To this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice 
according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded to the question—What is 
justice, stripped of appearances? The second division (2) includes the remainder 
of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books, which are mainly 
occupied with the construction of the first State and the first education. The 
third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which 
philosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry, and the second State 
is constructed on principles of communism and ruled by philosophers, and the 
contemplation of the idea of good takes the place of the social and political 
virtues. In the eighth and ninth books (4) the perversions of States and of the 
individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the nature of 
pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in the individual 
man. The tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole, in which the relations 
of philosophy to poetry are finally determined, and the happiness of the 
citizens in this life, which has now been assured, is crowned by the vision of 
another.</P>
<P id=id00018>Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the 
first (Books I-IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in 
accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the second 
(Books V-X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an ideal kingdom of 
philosophy, of which all other governments are the perversions. These two points 
of view are really opposed, and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of 
Plato. The Republic, like the Phaedrus, is an imperfect whole; the higher light 
of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the Hellenic temple, which at 
last fades away into the heavens. Whether this imperfection of structure arises 
from an enlargement of the plan; or from the imperfect reconcilement in the 
writer's own mind of the struggling elements of thought which are now first 
brought together by him; or, perhaps, from the composition of the work at 
different times—are questions, like the similar question about the Iliad and the 
Odyssey, which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinct answer. In the 
age of Plato there was no regular mode of publication, and an author would have 
the less scruple in altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few 
of his friends. There is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his 
labors aside for a time, or turned from one work to another; and such 
interruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a 
short writing. In all attempts to determine the chronological he order of the 
Platonic writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single 
Dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be 
admitted to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more than 
shorter ones. But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of the Republic 
may only arise out of the discordant elements which the philosopher has 
attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without being himself able to 
recognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us. For there is a judgment of 
after ages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for 
themselves. They do not perceive the want of connection in their own writings, 
or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to those who come after 
them. In the beginnings of literature and philosophy, amid the first efforts of 
thought and language, more inconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of 
speculation are well worn and the meaning of words precisely defined. For 
consistency, too, is the growth of time; and some of the greatest creations of 
the human mind have been wanting in unity. Tried by this test, several of the 
Platonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be defective, but 
the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different times or by 
different hands. And the supposition that the Republic was written 
uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmed by the 
numerous references from one part of the work to another.</P>
<P id=id00019>The second title, "Concerning Justice," is not the one by which 
the Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and, like 
the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore be assumed to 
be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked whether the definition of 
justice, which is the professed aim, or the construction of the State is the 
principal argument of the work. The answer is, that the two blend in one, and 
are two faces of the same truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the 
State is the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human 
society. The one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal of 
the State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body. In Hegelian 
phraseology the State is the reality of which justice is the ideal. Or, 
described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is within, and yet develops 
into a Church or external kingdom; "the house not made with hands, eternal in 
the heavens," is reduced to the proportions of an earthly building. Or, to use a 
Platonic image, justice and the State are the warp and the woof which run 
through the whole texture. And when the constitution of the State is completed, 
the conception of justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the same or 
different names throughout the work, both as the inner law of the individual 
soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and punishments in another life. 
The virtues are based on justice, of which common honesty in buying and selling 
is the shadow, and justice is based on the idea of good, which is the harmony of 
the world, and is reflected both in the institutions of States and in motions of 
the heavenly bodies. The Timaeus, which takes up the political rather than the 
ethical side of the Republic, and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning 
the outward world, yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed 
to reign over the State, over nature, and over man.</P>
<P id=id00020>Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient 
and in modern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether 
of nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient writings, and indeed 
in literature generally, there remains often a large element which was not 
comprehended in the original design. For the plan grows under the author's hand; 
new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing; he has not worked out the 
argument to the end before he begins. The reader who seeks to find some one idea 
under which the whole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest 
and most general. Thus Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary 
explanations of the argument of the Republic, imagines himself to have found the 
true argument "in the representation of human life in a State perfected by 
justice and governed according to the idea of good." There may be some use in 
such general descriptions, but they can hardly be said to express the design of 
the writer. The truth is, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; 
nor need anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind is 
naturally led by the association of ideas, and which does not interfere with the 
general purpose. What kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in a 
building, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem which has to be 
determined relatively to the subject-matter. To Plato himself, the inquiry "what 
was the intention of the writer," or "what was the principal argument of the 
Republic" would have been hardly intelligible, and therefore had better be at 
once dismissed.</P>
<P id=id00021>Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths 
which, to Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the 
State? Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or "the day of the 
Lord," or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the "Sun of righteousness 
with healing in his wings" only convey, to us at least, their great spiritual 
ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals to us his own thoughts about 
divine perfection, which is the idea of good—like the sun in the visible 
world;—about human perfection, which is justice—about education beginning in 
youth and continuing in later years—about poets and sophists and tyrants who are 
the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind—about "the world" which is the 
embodiment of them—about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid 
up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life. No such inspired creation 
is at unity with itself, any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces 
through them. Every shade of light and dark, of truth, and of fiction which is 
the veil of truth, is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination. It is 
not all on the same plane; it easily passes from ideas to myths and fancies, 
from facts to figures of speech. It is not prose but poetry, at least a great 
part of it, and ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or the 
probabilities of history. The writer is not fashioning his ideas into an 
artistic whole; they take possession of him and are too much for him. We have no 
need therefore to discuss whether a State such as Plato has conceived is 
practicable or not, or whether the outward form or the inward life came first 
into the mind of the writer. For the practicability of his ideas has nothing to 
do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly 
said to bear the greatest "marks of design"—justice more than the external 
frame-work of the State, the idea of good more than justice. The great science 
of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real content; but is only a 
type of the method or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by 
the spectator of all time and all existence. It is in the fifth, sixth, and 
seventh books that Plato reaches the "summit of speculation," and these, 
although they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker, may 
therefore be regarded as the most important, as they are also the most original, 
portions of the work.</P>
<P id=id00022>It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which 
has been raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the 
conversation was held (the year 411 B. C. which is proposed by him will do as 
well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a writer who, like 
Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology, only aims at general probability. 
Whether all the persons mentioned in the Republic could ever have met at any one 
time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an Athenian reading the 
work forty years later, or to Plato himself at the time of writing (any more 
than to Shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatly 
trouble us now. Yet this may be a question having no answer "which is still 
worth asking," because the investigation shows that we can not argue 
historically from the dates in Plato; it would be useless therefore to waste 
time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of them in order avoid 
chronological difficulties, such, for example, as the conjecture of C. F. 
Hermann, that Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of 
Plato, or the fancy of Stallbaum that Plato intentionally left anachronisms 
indicating the dates at which some of his Dialogues were written.</P>
<H3 style="MARGIN-TOP: 3em" id=id00023>CHARACTERS</H3>
<P id=id00024>The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, 
Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears 
in the introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument, 
and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book. The main 
discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Among the company 
are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus, the sons of Cephalus and brothers of 
Polemarchus, an unknown Charmantides—these are mute auditors; also there is 
Cleitophon, who once interrupts, where, as in the Dialogue which bears his name, 
he appears as the friend and ally of Thrasymachus.</P>
<P id=id00025>Cephalus, the patriarch of house, has been appropriately engaged 
in offering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old man who has almost done 
with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. He feels that he 
is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger around the memory of 
the past. He is eager that Socrates should come to visit him, fond of the poetry 
of the last generation, happy in the consciousness of a well-spent life, glad at 
having escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts. His love of conversation, his 
affection, his indifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting 
traits of character. He is not one of those who have nothing to say, because 
their whole mind has been absorbed in making money. Yet he acknowledges that 
riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to dishonesty or 
falsehood. The respectful attention shown to him by Socrates, whose love of 
conversation, no less than the mission imposed upon him by the Oracle, leads him 
to ask questions of all men, young and old alike, should also be noted. Who 
better suited to raise the question of justice than Cephalus, whose life might 
seem to be the expression of it? The moderation with which old age is pictured 
by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic, not only 
of him, but of Greek feeling generally, and contrasts with the exaggeration of 
Cicero in the De Senectute. The evening of life is described by Plato in the 
most expressive manner, yet with the fewest possible touches. As Cicero remarks 
(Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16), the aged Cephalus would have been out of place in the 
discussion which follows, and which he could neither have understood nor taken 
part in without a violation of dramatic propriety.</P>
<P id=id00026>His "son and heir" Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness 
of youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene, and will 
not "let him off" on the subject of women and children. Like Cephalus, he is 
limited in his point of view, and represents the proverbial stage of morality 
which has rules of life rather than principles; and he quotes Simonides as his 
father had quoted Pindar. But after this he has no more to say; the answers 
which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates. He has 
not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon and Adeimantus, 
nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he belongs to the 
pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. He is incapable of arguing, and is 
bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he does not know what he is saying. 
He is made to admit that justice is a thief, and that the virtues follow the 
analogy of the arts. From his brother Lysias we learn that he fell a victim to 
the Thirty Tyrants, but no allusion is here made to his fate, nor to the 
circumstance that Cephalus and his family were of Syracusan origin, and had 
migrated from Thurii to Athens.</P>
<P id=id00027>The "Chalcedonian giant," Thrasymachus, of whom we have already 
heard in the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according to 
Plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. He is vain 
and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond of making an 
oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable Socrates; but a mere child 
in argument, and unable to foresee that the next "move" (to use a Platonic 
expression) will "shut him up." He has reached the stage of framing general 
notions, and in this respect is in advance of Cephalus and Polemarchus. But he 
is incapable of defending them in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his 
confusion in banter and insolence. Whether such doctrines as are attributed to 
him by Plato were really held either by him or by any other Sophist is 
uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might 
easily grow up—they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers in Thucydides; 
but we are concerned at present with Plato's description of him, and not with 
the historical reality. The inequality of the contest adds greatly to the humor 
of the scene. The pompous and empty Sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of 
the great master of dialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity 
and weakness in him. He is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates, but his 
noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his 
assailant. His determination to cram down their throats, or put "bodily into 
their souls" his own words, elicits a cry of horror from Socrates. The state of 
his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process of the argument. Nothing 
is more amusing than his complete submission when he has been once thoroughly 
beaten. At first he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance, but soon 
with apparent good-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by 
one or two occasional remarks. When attacked by Glaucon he is humorously 
protected by Socrates "as one who has never been his enemy and is now his 
friend." From Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle's Rhetoric we learn that 
the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note whose writings 
were preserved in later ages. The play on his name which was made by his 
contemporary Herodicus, "thou wast ever bold in battle," seems to show that the 
description of him is not devoid of verisimilitude.</P>
<P id=id00028>When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal 
respondents, Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek 
tragedy, three actors are introduced. At first sight the two sons of Ariston may 
seem to wear a family likeness, like the two friends Simmias and Cebes in the 
Phaedo. But on a nearer examination of them the similarity vanishes, and they 
are seen to be distinct characters. Glaucon is the impetuous youth who can "just 
never have enough of fechting" (cf. the character of him in Xen. Mem. iii. 6); 
the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love; the "juvenis 
qui gaudet canibus," and who improves the breed of animals; the lover of art and 
music who has all the experiences of youthful life. He is full of quickness and 
penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus to the 
real difficulty; he turns out to the light the seamy side of human life, and yet 
does not lose faith in the just and true. It is Glaucon who seizes what may be 
termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state 
of simplicity is "a city of pigs," who is always prepared with a jest when the 
argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second the humor of 
Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs of music, 
or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the fantastic behavior of the citizens of 
democracy. His weaknesses are several times alluded to by Socrates, who, 
however, will not allow him to be attacked by his brother Adeimantus. He is a 
soldier, and, like Adeimantus, has been distinguished at the battle of 
Megara.</P>
<P id=id00029>The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the 
profounder objections are commonly put into his mouth. Glaucon is more 
demonstrative, and generally opens the game. Adeimantus pursues the argument 
further. Glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth; 
Adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of the world. In the 
second book, when Glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered 
without regard to their consequences, Adeimantus remarks that they are regarded 
by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences; and in a similar 
vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book that Socrates 
falls in making his citizens happy, and is answered that happiness is not the 
first but the second thing, not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of 
the good government of a State. In the discussion about religion and mythology, 
Adeimantus is the respondent, but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and 
carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the 
end of the book. It is Adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism of common 
sense on the Socratic method of argument, and who refuses to let Socrates pass 
lightly over the question of women and children. It is Adeimantus who is the 
respondent in the more argumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more 
imaginative portions of the Dialogue. For example, throughout the greater part 
of the sixth book, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception 
of the idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. Then Glaucon resumes his 
place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending the 
higher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits in the course of the 
discussion. Once more Adeimantus returns with the allusion to his brother 
Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious State; in the next book he is again 
superseded, and Glaucon continues to the end.</P>
<P id=id00030>Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive 
stages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden time, who 
is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his life by proverbs and 
saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of the Sophists, and lastly come 
the young disciples of the great teacher, who know the sophistical arguments but 
will not be convinced by them, and desire to go deeper into the nature of 
things. These too, like Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly 
distinguished from one another. Neither in the Republic, nor in any other 
Dialogue of Plato, is a single character repeated.</P>
<P id=id00031>The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly 
consistent. In the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is 
depicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues of Plato, and 
in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the old enemy of the 
Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well as to argue seriously. But 
in the sixth book his enmity towards the Sophists abates; he acknowledges that 
they are the representatives rather than the corrupters of the world. He also 
becomes more dogmatic and constructive, passing beyond the range either of the 
political or the speculative ideas of the real Socrates. In one passage Plato 
himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates, who had 
passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and not to be 
always repeating the notions of other men. There is no evidence that either the 
idea of good or the conception of a perfect State were comprehended in the 
Socratic teaching, though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal and 
of final causes (cp. Xen. Mem. i. 4; Phaedo 97); and a deep thinker like him in 
his thirty or forty years of public teaching, could hardly have falled to touch 
on the nature of family relations, for which there is also some positive 
evidence in the Memorabilia (Mem. i. 2, 51 foll.) The Socratic method is 
nominally retained; and every inference is either put into the mouth of the 
respondent or represented as the common discovery of him and Socrates. But any 
one can see that this is a mere form, of which the affectation grows wearisome 
as the work advances. The method of inquiry has passed into a method of teaching 
in which by the help of interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various 
points of view.</P>
<P id=id00032>The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, when 
he describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an 
investigation, but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the answer 
to a question more fluently than another.</P>
<P id=id00033>Neither can we be absolutely certain that, Socrates himself taught 
the immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in the 
Republic; nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or revelations 
of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that he would have banished 
poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology. His favorite oath is retained, and 
a slight mention is made of the daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to 
by Socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself. A real element of Socratic 
teaching, which is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other 
Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example and illustration ('taphorhtika auto 
prhospherhontez'): "Let us apply the test of common instances." "You," says 
Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, "are so unaccustomed to speak in 
images." And this use of examples or images, though truly Socratic in origin, is 
enlarged by the genius of Plato into the form of an allegory or parable, which 
embodies in the concrete what has been already described, or is about to be 
described, in the abstract. Thus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a 
recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in Book VI. The composite animal in 
Book IX is an allegory of the parts of the soul. The noble captain and the ship 
and the true pilot in Book VI are a figure of the relation of the people to the 
philosophers in the State which has been described. Other figures, such as the 
dog in the second, third, and fourth books, or the marriage of the portionless 
maiden in the sixth book, or the drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books, 
also form links of connection in long passages, or are used to recall previous 
discussions.</P>
<P id=id00034>Plato is most true to the character of his master when he 
describes him as "not of this world." And with this representation of him the 
ideal State and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance, 
though they can not be shown to have been speculations of Socrates. To him, as 
to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when they looked 
upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and evil. The common 
sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or has only partially admitted 
it. And even in Socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude at times 
passes into a sort of ironical pity or love. Men in general are incapable of 
philosophy, and are therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their 
misunderstanding of him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as he truly 
is in his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial systems possessing 
no native force of truth—words which admit of many applications. Their leaders 
have nothing to measure with, and are therefore ignorant of their own stature. 
But they are to be pitied or laughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean 
well with their nostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a 
Hydra's head. This moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most 
characteristic features of Socrates in the Republic. In all the different 
representations of Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato, and the differences 
of the earlier or later Dialogues, he always retains the character of the 
unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth, without which he would have 
ceased to be Socrates.</P>
<P id=id00035>Leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of the 
Republic, and then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic 
ideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of Plato may be 
read.</P>
<H1 style="MARGIN-TOP: 5em" id=id00036>BOOK I</H1>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id00037>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H4>
<P id=id00038>I WENT down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of 
Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because I 
wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new 
thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of the 
Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers 
and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that 
instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a 
distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and 
bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind, and said: 
Polemarchus desires you to wait.</P>
<P id=id00039>I turned round, and asked him where his master was.</P>
<P id=id00040>There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only 
wait.</P>
<P id=id00041>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus 
appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son of 
Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.</P>
<H5 id=id00042>SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS</H5>
<P id=id00043>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our 
companion are already on your way to the city.</P>
<P id=id00044>You are not far wrong, I said.</P>
<P id=id00045>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?</P>
<P id=id00046>Of course.</P>
<P id=id00047>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to 
remain where you are.</P>
<P id=id00048>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you 
to let us go?</P>
<P id=id00049>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he 
said.</P>
<P id=id00050>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.</P>
<P id=id00051>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.</P>
<P id=id00052>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on 
horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?</P>
<P id=id00053>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry 
torches and pass them one to another during the race?</P>
<P id=id00054>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he 
celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after 
supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we 
will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be perverse.</P>
<P id=id00055>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.</P>
<P id=id00056>Very good, I replied.</P>
<H5 id=id00057>GLAUCON - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES</H5>
<P id=id00058>Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we 
found his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the 
Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus. 
There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for a long 
time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned chair, and 
had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the court; and there 
were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat 
down by him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said:—</P>
<P id=id00059>You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I 
were still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at my 
age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener to the 
Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the body fade away, 
the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation. Do not then deny my 
request, but make our house your resort and keep company with these young men; 
we are old friends, and you will be quite at home with us.</P>
<P id=id00060>I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, 
Cephalus, than conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who 
have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire, 
whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is a 
question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which 
the poets call the 'threshold of old age'—Is life harder towards the end, or 
what report do you give of it?</P>
<P id=id00061>I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of 
my age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says; and 
at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is—I cannot eat, I cannot 
drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there was a good time 
once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life. Some complain of the 
slights which are put upon them by relations, and they will tell you sadly of 
how many evils their old age is the cause. But to me, Socrates, these 
complainers seem to blame that which is not really in fault. For if old age were 
the cause, I too being old, and every other old man, would have felt as they do. 
But this is not my own experience, nor that of others whom I have known. How 
well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How 
does love suit with age, Sophocles,—are you still the man you were? Peace, he 
replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I 
had escaped from a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my 
mind since, and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. 
For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions 
relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of 
one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, 
and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, 
which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm 
and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an 
opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden.</P>
<P id=id00062>I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he 
might go on—Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general 
are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old age sits 
lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but because you are 
rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.</P>
<P id=id00063>You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is 
something in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might 
answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and 
saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was an 
Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither of us 
would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and are impatient of old 
age, the same reply may be made; for to the good poor man old age cannot be a 
light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself.</P>
<P id=id00064>May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part 
inherited or acquired by you?</P>
<P id=id00065>Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In 
the art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather: 
for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of his 
patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but my father 
Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and I shall be 
satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little more than I 
received.</P>
<P id=id00066>That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see 
that you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of those 
who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them; the 
makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own, 
resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or of parents for their 
children, besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which 
is common to them and all men. And hence they are very bad company, for they can 
talk about nothing but the praises of wealth. That is true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00067>Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What do 
you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your 
wealth?</P>
<P id=id00068>One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince 
others. For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near 
death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the tales 
of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here 
were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with the thought 
that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or because he is now 
drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer view of these things; 
suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and 
consider what wrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of 
his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his 
sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. But to him who is 
conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says, is the kind nurse of 
his age:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00069>Hope, he says, cherishes 
the soul of him who lives in justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age 
and the companion of his journey;—hope which is mightiest to sway the restless 
soul of man.</P>
<P id=id00070>How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, I 
do not say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to 
deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally; and when 
he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about offerings due 
to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace of mind the 
possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say, that, setting one 
thing against another, of the many advantages which wealth has to give, to a man 
of sense this is in my opinion the greatest.</P>
<P id=id00071>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is 
it?—to speak the truth and to pay your debts—no more than this? And even to this 
are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has 
deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, 
ought I to give them back to him? No one would say that I ought or that I should 
be right in doing so, any more than they would say that I ought always to speak 
the truth to one who is in his condition.</P>
<P id=id00072>You are quite right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00073>But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not 
a correct definition of justice.</P>
<H5 id=id00074>CEPHALUS - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS</H5>
<P id=id00075>Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, 
said<BR>Polemarchus interposing.<BR></P>
<P id=id00076>I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look 
after the sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the 
company.</P>
<P id=id00077>Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.</P>
<P id=id00078>To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the 
sacrifices.</P>
<H5 id=id00079>SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS</H5>
<P id=id00080>Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, 
and according to you truly say, about justice?</P>
<P id=id00081>He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he 
appears to me to be right.</P>
<P id=id00082>I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired 
man, but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear to 
me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that I ought to return 
a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it when he is 
not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be denied to be a debt.</P>
<P id=id00083>True.</P>
<P id=id00084>Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by 
no means to make the return?</P>
<P id=id00085>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00086>When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he 
did not mean to include that case?</P>
<P id=id00087>Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good 
to a friend and never evil.</P>
<P id=id00088>You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the 
injury of the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of 
a debt,—that is what you would imagine him to say?</P>
<P id=id00089>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00090>And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?</P>
<P id=id00091>To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an 
enemy, as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him—that is 
to say, evil.</P>
<P id=id00092>Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have 
spoken darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that justice 
is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed a debt.</P>
<P id=id00093>That must have been his meaning, he said.</P>
<P id=id00094>By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing 
is given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would make 
to us?</P>
<P id=id00095>He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink 
to human bodies.</P>
<P id=id00096>And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?</P>
<P id=id00097>Seasoning to food.</P>
<P id=id00098>And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?</P>
<P id=id00099>If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the 
preceding instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and 
evil to enemies.</P>
<P id=id00100>That is his meaning then?</P>
<P id=id00101>I think so.</P>
<P id=id00102>And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his 
enemies in time of sickness?</P>
<P id=id00103>The physician.</P>
<P id=id00104>Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?</P>
<P id=id00105>The pilot.</P>
<P id=id00106>And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the 
just man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends?</P>
<P id=id00107>In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the 
other.</P>
<P id=id00108>But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a 
physician?</P>
<P id=id00109>No.</P>
<P id=id00110>And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?</P>
<P id=id00111>No.</P>
<P id=id00112>Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?</P>
<P id=id00113>I am very far from thinking so.</P>
<P id=id00114>You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in 
war?</P>
<P id=id00115>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00116>Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?</P>
<P id=id00117>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00118>Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,—that is what you 
mean?</P>
<P id=id00119>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00120>And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time 
of peace?</P>
<P id=id00121>In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.</P>
<P id=id00122>And by contracts you mean partnerships?</P>
<P id=id00123>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id00124>But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better 
partner at a game of draughts?</P>
<P id=id00125>The skilful player.</P>
<P id=id00126>And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more 
useful or better partner than the builder?</P>
<P id=id00127>Quite the reverse.</P>
<P id=id00128>Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner 
than the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a 
better partner than the just man?</P>
<P id=id00129>In a money partnership.</P>
<P id=id00130>Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do 
not want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse; a man 
who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would he not?</P>
<P id=id00131>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00132>And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would 
be better?</P>
<P id=id00133>True.</P>
<P id=id00134>Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just 
man is to be preferred?</P>
<P id=id00135>When you want a deposit to be kept safely.</P>
<P id=id00136>You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?</P>
<P id=id00137>Precisely.</P>
<P id=id00138>That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?</P>
<P id=id00139>That is the inference.</P>
<P id=id00140>And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is 
useful to the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the 
art of the vine-dresser?</P>
<P id=id00141>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id00142>And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, 
you would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then the 
art of the soldier or of the musician?</P>
<P id=id00143>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00144>And so of all the other things;—justice is useful when they are 
useless, and useless when they are useful?</P>
<P id=id00145>That is the inference.</P>
<P id=id00146>Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this 
further point: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any 
kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?</P>
<P id=id00147>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00148>And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a 
disease is best able to create one?</P>
<P id=id00149>True.</P>
<P id=id00150>And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a 
march upon the enemy?</P>
<P id=id00151>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00152>Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?</P>
<P id=id00153>That, I suppose, is to be inferred.</P>
<P id=id00154>Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at 
stealing it.</P>
<P id=id00155>That is implied in the argument.</P>
<P id=id00156>Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this 
is a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he, speaking 
of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a favourite of his, 
affirms that</P>
<P id=id00157>He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.</P>
<P id=id00158>And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an 
art of theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm 
of enemies,'—that was what you were saying?</P>
<P id=id00159>No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; 
but I still stand by the latter words.</P>
<P id=id00160>Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean 
those who are so really, or only in seeming?</P>
<P id=id00161>Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he 
thinks good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.</P>
<P id=id00162>Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who 
are not good seem to be so, and conversely?</P>
<P id=id00163>That is true.</P>
<P id=id00164>Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their 
friends? True.</P>
<P id=id00165>And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and 
evil to the good?</P>
<P id=id00166>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id00167>But the good are just and would not do an injustice?</P>
<P id=id00168>True.</P>
<P id=id00169>Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do 
no wrong?</P>
<P id=id00170>Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.</P>
<P id=id00171>Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to 
the unjust?</P>
<P id=id00172>I like that better.</P>
<P id=id00173>But see the consequence:—Many a man who is ignorant of human 
nature has friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to 
them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we shall be 
saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning of 
Simonides.</P>
<P id=id00174>Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an 
error into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and 
'enemy.'</P>
<P id=id00175>What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.</P>
<P id=id00176>We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought 
good.</P>
<P id=id00177>And how is the error to be corrected?</P>
<P id=id00178>We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, 
good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not a 
friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.</P>
<P id=id00179>You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our 
enemies?</P>
<P id=id00180>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00181>And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just 
to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It is 
just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when 
they are evil?</P>
<P id=id00182>Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.</P>
<P id=id00183>But ought the just to injure any one at all?</P>
<P id=id00184>Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his 
enemies.</P>
<P id=id00185>When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?</P>
<P id=id00186>The latter.</P>
<P id=id00187>Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not 
of dogs?</P>
<P id=id00188>Yes, of horses.</P>
<P id=id00189>And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not 
of horses?</P>
<P id=id00190>Of course.</P>
<P id=id00191>And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is 
the proper virtue of man?</P>
<P id=id00192>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00193>And that human virtue is justice?</P>
<P id=id00194>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id00195>Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?</P>
<P id=id00196>That is the result.</P>
<P id=id00197>But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?</P>
<P id=id00198>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00199>Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?</P>
<P id=id00200>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id00201>And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general 
can the good by virtue make them bad?</P>
<P id=id00202>Assuredly not.</P>
<P id=id00203>Any more than heat can produce cold?</P>
<P id=id00204>It cannot.</P>
<P id=id00205>Or drought moisture?</P>
<P id=id00206>Clearly not.</P>
<P id=id00207>Nor can the good harm any one?</P>
<P id=id00208>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id00209>And the just is the good?</P>
<P id=id00210>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00211>Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just 
man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?</P>
<P id=id00212>I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.</P>
<P id=id00213>Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of 
debts, and that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends, and evil the 
debt which he owes to his enemies,—to say this is not wise; for it is not true, 
if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be in no case 
just.</P>
<P id=id00214>I agree with you, said Polemarchus.</P>
<P id=id00215>Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who 
attributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man 
or seer?</P>
<P id=id00216>I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.</P>
<P id=id00217>Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?</P>
<P id=id00218>Whose?</P>
<P id=id00219>I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the 
Theban, or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own 
power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm 
to your enemies.'</P>
<P id=id00220>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00221>Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, 
what other can be offered?</P>
<P id=id00222>Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had 
made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down by 
the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when Polemarchus and I 
had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no longer hold his peace; and, 
gathering himself up, he came at us like a wild beast, seeking to devour us. We 
were quite panic-stricken at the sight of him.</P>
<H5 id=id00223>SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS</H5>
<P id=id00224>He roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, has 
taken possession of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one 
another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should not 
only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from the 
refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many a one who 
can ask and cannot answer. And now I will not have you say that justice is duty 
or advantage or profit or gain or interest, for this sort of nonsense will not 
do for me; I must have clearness and accuracy.</P>
<P id=id00225>I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him 
without trembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I 
should have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked at him 
first, and was therefore able to reply to him.</P>
<P id=id00226>Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. 
Polemarchus and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but 
I can assure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking for a 
piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under to one 
another,' and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when we are seeking 
for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do you say that we 
are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at the truth? 
Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and anxious to do so, but the fact is 
that we cannot. And if so, you people who know all things should pity us and not 
be angry with us.</P>
<P id=id00227>How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter 
laugh;—that's your ironical style! Did I not foresee—have I not already told 
you, that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or any 
other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?</P>
<P id=id00228>You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that 
if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit him 
whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six times two, or 
four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for me,'—then 
obviously, that is your way of putting the question, no one can answer you. But 
suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus, what do you mean? If one of these 
numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to 
say some other number which is not the right one?—is that your meaning?'—How 
would you answer him?</P>
<P id=id00229>Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he said.</P>
<P id=id00230>Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but 
only appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he 
thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?</P>
<P id=id00231>I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted 
answers?</P>
<P id=id00232>I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon 
reflection I approve of any of them.</P>
<P id=id00233>But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, 
he said, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to you?</P>
<P id=id00234>Done to me!—as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the 
wise—that is what I deserve to have done to me.</P>
<P id=id00235>What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!</P>
<P id=id00236>I will pay when I have the money, I replied.</P>
<H5 id=id00237>SOCRATES - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id00238>But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need 
be under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for 
Socrates.</P>
<P id=id00239>Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always 
does—refuse to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some 
one else.</P>
<P id=id00240>Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and 
says that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions of 
his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The natural thing is, 
that the speaker should be some one like yourself who professes to know and can 
tell what he knows. Will you then kindly answer, for the edification of the 
company and of myself?</P>
<P id=id00241>Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and 
Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he 
thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself. But at 
first he to insist on my answering; at length he consented to begin. Behold, he 
said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach himself, and goes about 
learning of others, to whom he never even says thank you.</P>
<P id=id00242>That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am 
ungrateful I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in praise, 
which is all I have: and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to me to 
speak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for I expect that you 
will answer well.</P>
<P id=id00243>Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else 
than the interest of the stronger. And now why do you not me? But of course you 
won't.</P>
<P id=id00244>Let me first understand you, I replied. Justice, as you say, is 
the interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this? You 
cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger than we 
are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength, that to eat 
beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is, and right and 
just for us?</P>
<P id=id00245>That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the 
sense which is most damaging to the argument.</P>
<P id=id00246>Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; 
and I wish that you would be a little clearer.</P>
<P id=id00247>Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government 
differ; there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are 
aristocracies?</P>
<P id=id00248>Yes, I know.</P>
<P id=id00249>And the government is the ruling power in each state?</P>
<P id=id00250>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00251>And the different forms of government make laws democratical, 
aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and these 
laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the justice which they 
deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses them they punish as a 
breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean when I say that in all 
states there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of the 
government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the only 
reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle of justice, 
which is the interest of the stronger.</P>
<P id=id00252>Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I 
will try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have 
yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It is true, 
however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are added.</P>
<P id=id00253>A small addition, you must allow, he said.</P>
<P id=id00254>Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire 
whether what you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is 
interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about this 
addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.</P>
<P id=id00255>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id00256>I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or 
subjects to obey their rulers?</P>
<P id=id00257>I do.</P>
<P id=id00258>But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they 
sometimes liable to err?</P>
<P id=id00259>To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.</P>
<P id=id00260>Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, 
and sometimes not?</P>
<P id=id00261>True.</P>
<P id=id00262>When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their 
interest; when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit 
that?</P>
<P id=id00263>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00264>And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,—and 
that is what you call justice?</P>
<P id=id00265>Doubtless.</P>
<P id=id00266>Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to 
the interest of the stronger but the reverse?</P>
<P id=id00267>What is that you are saying? he asked.</P>
<P id=id00268>I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us 
consider: Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own 
interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has not 
that been admitted?</P>
<P id=id00269>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00270>Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the 
interest of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be 
done which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the obedience 
which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of men, is 
there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do, not 
what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the stronger?</P>
<P id=id00271>Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.</P>
<H5 id=id00272>SOCRATES - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS</H5>
<P id=id00273>Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his 
witness.</P>
<P id=id00274>But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for 
Thrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not 
for their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.</P>
<P id=id00275>Yes, Polemarchus,—Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what 
was commanded by their rulers is just.</P>
<P id=id00276>Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of 
the stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further 
acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects to do 
what is not for his own interest; whence follows that justice is the injury 
quite as much as the interest of the stronger.</P>
<P id=id00277>But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger 
what the stronger thought to be his interest,—this was what the weaker had to 
do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.</P>
<P id=id00278>Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.</P>
<H5 id=id00279>SOCRATES - THRASYMACHUS</H5>
<P id=id00280>Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept 
his statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what the 
stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?</P>
<P id=id00281>Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is 
mistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?</P>
<P id=id00282>Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted 
that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.</P>
<P id=id00283>You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, 
that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken? or 
that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at 
the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake? True, we say 
that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, but this 
is only a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any 
other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name 
implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them, and then they 
cease to be skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he 
is what his name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and I adopted the 
common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are such a 
lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he is the ruler, 
is unerring, and, being unerring, always commands that which is for his own 
interest; and the subject is required to execute his commands; and therefore, as 
I said at first and now repeat, justice is the interest of the stronger.</P>
<P id=id00284>Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like 
an informer?</P>
<P id=id00285>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00286>And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of 
injuring you in the argument?</P>
<P id=id00287>Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word—I know it; but you will 
be found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.</P>
<P id=id00288>I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any 
misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do 
you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being 
the superior, it is just that the inferior should execute—is he a ruler in the 
popular or in the strict sense of the term?</P>
<P id=id00289>In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play 
the informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never will be 
able, never.</P>
<P id=id00290>And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and 
cheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.</P>
<P id=id00291>Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you 
failed.</P>
<P id=id00292>Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I 
should ask you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which 
you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember that I 
am now speaking of the true physician.</P>
<P id=id00293>A healer of the sick, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00294>And the pilot—that is to say, the true pilot—is he a captain of 
sailors or a mere sailor?</P>
<P id=id00295>A captain of sailors.</P>
<P id=id00296>The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into 
account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he is 
distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of his skill 
and of his authority over the sailors.</P>
<P id=id00297>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00298>Now, I said, every art has an interest?</P>
<P id=id00299>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00300>For which the art has to consider and provide?</P>
<P id=id00301>Yes, that is the aim of art.</P>
<P id=id00302>And the interest of any art is the perfection of it—this and 
nothing else?</P>
<P id=id00303>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id00304>I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the 
body. Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has 
wants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may be ill and 
require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine 
ministers; and this is the origin and intention of medicine, as you will 
acknowledge. Am I not right?</P>
<P id=id00305>Quite right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00306>But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in 
any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear 
fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests 
of seeing and hearing—has art in itself, I say, any similar liability to fault 
or defect, and does every art require another supplementary art to provide for 
its interests, and that another and another without end? Or have the arts to 
look only after their own interests? Or have they no need either of themselves 
or of another?—having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct them, 
either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they have only to 
consider the interest of their subject-matter. For every art remains pure and 
faultless while remaining true—that is to say, while perfect and unimpaired. 
Take the words in your precise sense, and tell me whether I am not right."</P>
<P id=id00307>Yes, clearly.</P>
<P id=id00308>Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the 
interest of the body?</P>
<P id=id00309>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id00310>Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art 
of horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts care 
for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which is the 
subject of their art?</P>
<P id=id00311>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id00312>But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of 
their own subjects?</P>
<P id=id00313>To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.</P>
<P id=id00314>Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest 
of the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and 
weaker?</P>
<P id=id00315>He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally 
acquiesced.</P>
<P id=id00316>Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, 
considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for 
the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, and is 
not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?</P>
<P id=id00317>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00318>And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a 
ruler of sailors and not a mere sailor?</P>
<P id=id00319>That has been admitted.</P>
<P id=id00320>And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the 
interest of the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's 
interest?</P>
<P id=id00321>He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'</P>
<P id=id00322>Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so 
far as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest, but 
always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art; to that 
he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he says and does.</P>
<P id=id00323>When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw 
that the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus, instead 
of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a nurse?</P>
<P id=id00324>Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to 
be answering?</P>
<P id=id00325>Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she 
has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.</P>
<P id=id00326>What makes you say that? I replied.</P>
<P id=id00327>Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends 
the sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself 
or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of states, if they are 
true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and that they are not 
studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; and so entirely astray are 
you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know that justice and 
the just are in reality another's good; that is to say, the interest of the 
ruler and stronger, and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice the 
opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is the 
stronger, and his subjects do what is for his interest, and minister to his 
happiness, which is very far from being their own. Consider further, most 
foolish Socrates, that the just is always a loser in comparison with the unjust. 
First of all, in private contracts: wherever the unjust is the partner of the 
just you will find that, when the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has 
always more and the just less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when 
there is an income tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the 
same amount of income; and when there is anything to be received the one gains 
nothing and the other much. Observe also what happens when they take an office; 
there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses, 
and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover he is hated 
by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways. But 
all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man. I am speaking, as before, of 
injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is more 
apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that highest 
form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men, and the 
sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable—that is to 
say tyranny, which by fraud and force takes away the property of others, not 
little by little but wholesale; comprehending in one, things sacred as well as 
profane, private and public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected 
perpetrating any one of them singly, he would be punished and incur great 
disgrace—they who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of 
temples, and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man 
besides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them, then, 
instead of these names of reproach, he is termed happy and blessed, not only by 
the citizens but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of 
injustice. For mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims 
of it and not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown, 
Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom 
and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of 
the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit and interest.</P>
<P id=id00328>Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman, 
deluged our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company would 
not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position; and I 
myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us. Thrasymachus, I 
said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your remarks! And are you going 
to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or 
not? Is the attempt to determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your 
eyes—to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest 
advantage?</P>
<P id=id00329>And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the 
enquiry?</P>
<P id=id00330>You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us, 
Thrasymachus—whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you say you 
know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend, do not keep your 
knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any benefit which you confer 
upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part I openly declare that I am not 
convinced, and that I do not believe injustice to be more gainful than justice, 
even if uncontrolled and allowed to have free play. For, granting that there may 
be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force, still 
this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice, and there may 
be others who are in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; 
if so, you in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring 
justice to injustice.</P>
<P id=id00331>And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already 
convinced by what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have 
me put the proof bodily into your souls?</P>
<P id=id00332>Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, 
if you change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must remark, 
Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that although you 
began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you did not observe a 
like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought that the shepherd as a 
shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own good, but like a mere 
diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table; or, again, as a 
trader for sale in the market, and not as a shepherd. Yet surely the art of the 
shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects; he has only to provide 
the best for them, since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever 
all the requirements of it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just 
now about the ruler. I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, 
whether in a state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock 
or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states, that is to 
say, the true rulers, like being in authority.</P>
<P id=id00333>Think! Nay, I am sure of it.</P>
<P id=id00334>Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them 
willingly without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the 
advantage not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question: Are not 
the several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function? 
And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make a 
little progress.</P>
<P id=id00335>Yes, that is the difference, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00336>And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general 
one—medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and so 
on?</P>
<P id=id00337>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id00338>And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but 
we do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot is to 
be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot may be 
improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would you, that 
navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of 
language?</P>
<P id=id00339>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00340>Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would 
not say that the art of payment is medicine?</P>
<P id=id00341>I should say not.</P>
<P id=id00342>Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay 
because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?</P>
<P id=id00343>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00344>And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is 
specially confined to the art?</P>
<P id=id00345>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00346>Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that 
is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common use?</P>
<P id=id00347>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00348>And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is 
gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed by 
him?</P>
<P id=id00349>He gave a reluctant assent to this.</P>
<P id=id00350>Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their 
respective arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, 
and the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which is the 
art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that 
over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit from his art 
unless he were paid as well?</P>
<P id=id00351>I suppose not.</P>
<P id=id00352>But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for 
nothing?</P>
<P id=id00353>Certainly, he confers a benefit.</P>
<P id=id00354>Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither 
arts nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before 
saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are the 
weaker and not the stronger—to their good they attend and not to the good of the 
superior.</P>
<P id=id00355>And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just 
now saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take in hand 
the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration. For, in 
the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist 
does not regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore 
in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of three 
modes of payment: money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.</P>
<H5 id=id00356>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id00357>What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of 
payment are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, or 
how a penalty can be a payment.</P>
<P id=id00358>You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment 
which to the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know that 
ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?</P>
<P id=id00359>Very true.</P>
<P id=id00360>And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction 
for them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and 
so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves out of the 
public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious they do not 
care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, and they must be 
induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the 
reason why the forwardness to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, 
has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he 
who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And 
the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office, not because 
they would, but because they cannot help—not under the idea that they are going 
to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because 
they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than 
themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were 
composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object 
of contention as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof 
that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that 
of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a 
benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one. So far am I 
from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger. 
This latter question need not be further discussed at present; but when 
Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of 
the just, his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character. 
Which of us has spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you 
prefer?</P>
<P id=id00361>I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more 
advantageous, he answered.</P>
<P id=id00362>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus 
was rehearsing?</P>
<P id=id00363>Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.</P>
<P id=id00364>Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, 
that he is saying what is not true?</P>
<P id=id00365>Most certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00366>If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting 
all the advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must be a 
numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side, and in 
the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our enquiry as we 
lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall unite the offices of 
judge and advocate in our own persons.</P>
<P id=id00367>Very good, he said.</P>
<P id=id00368>And which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.</P>
<P id=id00369>That which you propose.</P>
<P id=id00370>Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the 
beginning and answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than 
perfect justice?</P>
<H5 id=id00371>SOCRATES - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS</H5>
<P id=id00372>Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.</P>
<P id=id00373>And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them 
virtue and the other vice?</P>
<P id=id00374>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00375>I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice 
vice?</P>
<P id=id00376>What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm 
injustice to be profitable and justice not.</P>
<P id=id00377>What else then would you say?</P>
<P id=id00378>The opposite, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00379>And would you call justice vice?</P>
<P id=id00380>No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.</P>
<P id=id00381>Then would you call injustice malignity?</P>
<P id=id00382>No; I would rather say discretion.</P>
<P id=id00383>And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?</P>
<P id=id00384>Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be 
perfectly unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but 
perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.</P>
<P id=id00385>Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they are 
not to be compared with those of which I was just now speaking.</P>
<P id=id00386>I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I 
replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice with 
wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.</P>
<P id=id00387>Certainly I do so class them.</P>
<P id=id00388>Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable 
ground; for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had 
been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer might have 
been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive that you will call 
injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust you will attribute all the 
qualities which were attributed by us before to the just, seeing that you do not 
hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue.</P>
<P id=id00389>You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00390>Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the 
argument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking 
your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not amusing 
yourself at our expense.</P>
<P id=id00391>I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?—to refute the 
argument is your business.</P>
<P id=id00392>Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so 
good as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any 
advantage over the just?</P>
<P id=id00393>Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature 
which he is.</P>
<P id=id00394>And would he try to go beyond just action?</P>
<P id=id00395>He would not.</P>
<P id=id00396>And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the 
unjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?</P>
<P id=id00397>He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but 
he would not be able.</P>
<P id=id00398>Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the 
point. My question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more 
than another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?</P>
<P id=id00399>Yes, he would.</P>
<P id=id00400>And what of the unjust—does he claim to have more than the just 
man and to do more than is just.</P>
<P id=id00401>Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.</P>
<P id=id00402>And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than 
the unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?</P>
<P id=id00403>True.</P>
<P id=id00404>We may put the matter thus, I said—the just does not desire more 
than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than 
both his like and his unlike?</P>
<P id=id00405>Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.</P>
<P id=id00406>And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?</P>
<P id=id00407>Good again, he said.</P>
<P id=id00408>And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike 
them?</P>
<P id=id00409>Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those 
who are of a certain nature; he who is not, not.</P>
<P id=id00410>Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?</P>
<P id=id00411>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00412>Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the 
arts: you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?</P>
<P id=id00413>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00414>And which is wise and which is foolish?</P>
<P id=id00415>Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is 
foolish.</P>
<P id=id00416>And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is 
foolish?</P>
<P id=id00417>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00418>And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?</P>
<P id=id00419>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00420>And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he 
adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the 
tightening and loosening the strings?</P>
<P id=id00421>I do not think that he would.</P>
<P id=id00422>But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?</P>
<P id=id00423>Of course.</P>
<P id=id00424>And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and 
drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of 
medicine?</P>
<P id=id00425>He would not.</P>
<P id=id00426>But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?</P>
<P id=id00427>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00428>And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you 
think that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of 
saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say 
or do the same as his like in the same case?</P>
<P id=id00429>That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.</P>
<P id=id00430>And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than 
either the knowing or the ignorant?</P>
<P id=id00431>I dare say.</P>
<P id=id00432>And the knowing is wise?</P>
<P id=id00433>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00434>And the wise is good?</P>
<P id=id00435>True.</P>
<P id=id00436>Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, 
but more than his unlike and opposite?</P>
<P id=id00437>I suppose so.</P>
<P id=id00438>Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than 
both?</P>
<P id=id00439>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00440>But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both 
his like and unlike? Were not these your words? They were.</P>
<P id=id00441>They were.</P>
<P id=id00442>And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but 
his unlike?</P>
<P id=id00443>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00444>Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the 
evil and ignorant?</P>
<P id=id00445>That is the inference.</P>
<P id=id00446>And each of them is such as his like is?</P>
<P id=id00447>That was admitted.</P>
<P id=id00448>Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust 
evil and ignorant.</P>
<P id=id00449>Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat 
them, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the 
perspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had never seen 
before, Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed that justice was virtue and 
wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to another point:</P>
<P id=id00450>Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were 
we not also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?</P>
<P id=id00451>Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of 
what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be 
quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my 
say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as 
they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'</P>
<P id=id00452>Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.</P>
<P id=id00453>Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me 
speak.<BR>What else would you have?<BR></P>
<P id=id00454>Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will 
ask and you shall answer.</P>
<P id=id00455>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id00456>Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order 
that our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be 
carried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger and more 
powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with wisdom and 
virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice is 
ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But I want to view the 
matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that a state may be 
unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have 
already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in subjection?</P>
<P id=id00457>True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust 
state will be most likely to do so.</P>
<P id=id00458>I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would 
further consider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state 
can exist or be exercised without justice.</P>
<P id=id00459>If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only 
with justice; but if I am right, then without justice.</P>
<P id=id00460>I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent 
and dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.</P>
<P id=id00461>That is out of civility to you, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00462>You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to 
inform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers and 
thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured one 
another?</P>
<P id=id00463>No indeed, he said, they could not.</P>
<P id=id00464>But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might 
act together better?</P>
<P id=id00465>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00466>And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and 
fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, 
Thrasymachus?</P>
<P id=id00467>I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.</P>
<P id=id00468>How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether 
injustice, having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among 
slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at 
variance and render them incapable of common action?</P>
<P id=id00469>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00470>And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel 
and fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just.</P>
<P id=id00471>They will.</P>
<P id=id00472>And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your 
wisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power?</P>
<P id=id00473>Let us assume that she retains her power.</P>
<P id=id00474>Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature 
that wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a 
family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered incapable of 
united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become its 
own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just? Is not 
this the case?</P>
<P id=id00475>Yes, certainly.</P>
<P id=id00476>And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single 
person; in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not 
at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself 
and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?</P>
<P id=id00477>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00478>And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?</P>
<P id=id00479>Granted that they are.</P>
<P id=id00480>But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just 
will be their friend?</P>
<P id=id00481>Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will 
not oppose you, lest I should displease the company.</P>
<P id=id00482>Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the 
remainder of my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly 
wiser and better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable of 
common action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did of men who are evil 
acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for if they had 
been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one another; but it is 
evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in them, which enabled 
them to combine; if there had not been they would have injured one another as 
well as their victims; they were but half—villains in their enterprises; for had 
they been whole villains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly 
incapable of action. That, as I believe, is the truth of the matter, and not 
what you said at first. But whether the just have a better and happier life than 
the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider. I think 
that they have, and for the reasons which to have given; but still I should like 
to examine further, for no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the rule 
of human life.</P>
<P id=id00483>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id00484>I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a 
horse has some end?</P>
<P id=id00485>I should.</P>
<P id=id00486>And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which 
could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?</P>
<P id=id00487>I do not understand, he said.</P>
<P id=id00488>Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?</P>
<P id=id00489>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00490>Or hear, except with the ear?</P>
<P id=id00491>No.</P>
<P id=id00492>These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?</P>
<P id=id00493>They may.</P>
<P id=id00494>But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, 
and in many other ways?</P>
<P id=id00495>Of course.</P>
<P id=id00496>And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the 
purpose?</P>
<P id=id00497>True.</P>
<P id=id00498>May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?</P>
<P id=id00499>We may.</P>
<P id=id00500>Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my 
meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that 
which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other 
thing?</P>
<P id=id00501>I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.</P>
<P id=id00502>And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need 
I ask again whether the eye has an end?</P>
<P id=id00503>It has.</P>
<P id=id00504>And has not the eye an excellence?</P>
<P id=id00505>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00506>And the ear has an end and an excellence also?</P>
<P id=id00507>True.</P>
<P id=id00508>And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them 
an end and a special excellence?</P>
<P id=id00509>That is so.</P>
<P id=id00510>Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in 
their own proper excellence and have a defect instead?</P>
<P id=id00511>How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?</P>
<P id=id00512>You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which 
is sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the 
question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their 
ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall of fulfilling them by 
their own defect?</P>
<P id=id00513>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00514>I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own 
proper excellence they cannot fulfil their end?</P>
<P id=id00515>True.</P>
<P id=id00516>And the same observation will apply to all other things?</P>
<P id=id00517>I agree.</P>
<P id=id00518>Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? 
for example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not 
these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any 
other?</P>
<P id=id00519>To no other.</P>
<P id=id00520>And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?</P>
<P id=id00521>Assuredly, he said.</P>
<P id=id00522>And has not the soul an excellence also?</P>
<P id=id00523>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00524>And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of 
that excellence?</P>
<P id=id00525>She cannot.</P>
<P id=id00526>Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and 
superintendent, and the good soul a good ruler?</P>
<P id=id00527>Yes, necessarily.</P>
<P id=id00528>And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, 
and injustice the defect of the soul?</P>
<P id=id00529>That has been admitted.</P>
<P id=id00530>Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust 
man will live ill?</P>
<P id=id00531>That is what your argument proves.</P>
<P id=id00532>And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill 
the reverse of happy?</P>
<P id=id00533>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00534>Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?</P>
<P id=id00535>So be it.</P>
<P id=id00536>But happiness and not misery is profitable.</P>
<P id=id00537>Of course.</P>
<P id=id00538>Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more 
profitable than justice.</P>
<P id=id00539>Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the 
Bendidea.</P>
<P id=id00540>For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown 
gentle towards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been well 
entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure snatches a 
taste of every dish which is successively brought to table, he not having 
allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I gone from one subject to 
another without having discovered what I sought at first, the nature of justice. 
I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and 
wisdom or evil and folly; and when there arose a further question about the 
comparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could not refrain from 
passing on to that. And the result of the whole discussion has been that I know 
nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and therefore I am not likely to 
know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor can I say whether the just man is 
happy or unhappy.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id00541>BOOK II</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id00542>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H4>
<P id=id00543>WITH these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the 
discussion; but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon, 
who is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus' 
retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates, do you 
wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us, that to be 
just is always better than to be unjust?</P>
<P id=id00544>I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.</P>
<P id=id00545>Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now:—How 
would you arrange goods—are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes, 
and independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures and 
enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows from 
them?</P>
<P id=id00546>I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.</P>
<P id=id00547>Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, 
sight, health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their 
results?</P>
<P id=id00548>Certainly, I said.</P>
<P id=id00549>And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and 
the care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of 
money-making—these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one 
would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or 
result which flows from them?</P>
<P id=id00550>There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you ask?</P>
<P id=id00551>Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would 
place justice?</P>
<P id=id00552>In the highest class, I replied,—among those goods which he who 
would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their 
results.</P>
<P id=id00553>Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to 
be reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued for 
the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable and 
rather to be avoided.</P>
<P id=id00554>I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that 
this was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he 
censured justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced by 
him.</P>
<P id=id00555>I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I 
shall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like a snake, 
to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been; but to my 
mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear. Setting 
aside their rewards and results, I want to know what they are in themselves, and 
how they inwardly work in the soul. If you, please, then, I will revive the 
argument of Thrasymachus. And first I will speak of the nature and origin of 
justice according to the common view of them. Secondly, I will show that all men 
who practise justice do so against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. 
And thirdly, I will argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the 
unjust is after all better far than the life of the just—if what they say is 
true, Socrates, since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge 
that I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of others 
dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet heard the 
superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way. 
I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself; then I shall be satisfied, 
and you are the person from whom I think that I am most likely to hear this; and 
therefore I will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner 
of speaking will indicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too praising 
justice and censuring injustice. Will you say whether you approve of my 
proposal?</P>
<P id=id00556>Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of 
sense would oftener wish to converse.</P>
<P id=id00557>I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by 
speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.</P>
<H5 id=id00558>GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id00559>They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer 
injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men 
have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being 
able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better 
agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual 
covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. 
This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;—it is a mean or 
compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be 
punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power 
of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is 
tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the 
inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man 
would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be 
mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin 
of justice.</P>
<P id=id00560>Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and 
because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine 
something of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do 
what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then we 
shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along 
the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to be their 
good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law. The 
liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form 
of such a power as is said to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of 
Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the 
service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made an 
opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed at the 
sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other marvels, he beheld a 
hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a 
dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on 
but a gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now 
the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their 
monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having 
the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the 
collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the 
rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer 
present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned the 
collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring, and always 
with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when 
outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the 
messengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived he seduced 
the queen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and took 
the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put 
on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an 
iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off 
what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, 
or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from 
prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the 
actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come 
at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that 
a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to 
him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can 
safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their hearts that 
injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who 
argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could 
imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any 
wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to 
be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, 
and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer 
injustice. Enough of this.</P>
<P id=id00561>Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and 
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the isolation to 
be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust, and the just man 
entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of them, and both are to 
be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives. First, let the 
unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or 
physician, who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, 
and who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the unjust 
make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means to be 
great in his injustice (he who is found out is nobody): for the highest reach of 
injustice is: to be deemed just when you are not. Therefore I say that in the 
perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be 
no deduction, but we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have 
acquired the greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he 
must be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if 
any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is 
required his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And at his 
side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity, wishing, as 
Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no seeming, for if he 
seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not know 
whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and 
rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice only, and have no other 
covering; and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former. 
Let him be the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have 
been put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear 
of infamy and its consequences. And let him continue thus to the hour of death; 
being just and seeming to be unjust. When both have reached the uttermost 
extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let judgment be given 
which of them is the happier of the two.</P>
<H5 id=id00562>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id00563>Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish 
them up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two 
statues.</P>
<P id=id00564>I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like 
there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of 
them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the description a 
little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the words which follow 
are not mine.— Let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice: 
They will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged, 
racked, bound—will have his eyes burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every 
kind of evil, he will be impaled: Then he will understand that he ought to seem 
only, and not to be, just; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of 
the unjust than of the just. For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not 
live with a view to appearances—he wants to be really unjust and not to seem 
only:—</P>
<P id=id00565>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind has a soil deep and 
fertile,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of which spring his prudent 
counsels.<BR></P>
<P id=id00566>In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule 
in the city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will; 
also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own advantage, 
because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest, whether in 
public or private, he gets the better of his antagonists, and gains at their 
expense, and is rich, and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm 
his enemies; moreover, he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods 
abundantly and magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants 
to honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely to be 
dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men are said to 
unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just.</P>
<H5 id=id00567>ADEIMANTUS - SOCRATES</H5>
<P id=id00568>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when 
Adeimantus, his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that 
there is nothing more to be urged?</P>
<P id=id00569>Why, what else is there? I answered.</P>
<P id=id00570>The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he 
replied.</P>
<P id=id00571>Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help 
brother'—if he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that 
Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me 
the power of helping justice.</P>
<H5 id=id00572>ADEIMANTUS</H5>
<P id=id00573>Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is 
another side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and 
injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe to be 
his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards 
that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice, but for the sake 
of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed 
just some of those offices, marriages, and the like which Glaucon has enumerated 
among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice. 
More, however, is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the 
others; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a 
shower of benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this 
accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom 
says, that the gods make the oaks of the just—</P>
<P id=id00574>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I 
the middle;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sheep the bowed down bowed the 
with the their fleeces.<BR></P>
<P id=id00575>and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And 
Homer has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is—</P>
<P id=id00576>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fame of some blameless king who, 
like a god,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintains justice to whom the black earth 
brings forth<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed 
with fruit,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his sheep never fail to bear, and the 
sea gives him fish.<BR></P>
<P id=id00577>Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son 
vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where they have 
the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with 
garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the 
highest meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as 
they say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth 
generation. This is the style in which they praise justice. But about the wicked 
there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them 
carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to 
infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the 
portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their 
invention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the 
other.</P>
<P id=id00578>Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of 
speaking about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but is 
found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always declaring that 
justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome; and that the 
pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and are only censured by 
law and opinion. They say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable 
than dishonesty; and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to 
honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way 
influential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor, 
even though acknowledging them to be better than the others. But most 
extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods: they 
say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men, and good and 
happiness to the wicked. And mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and 
persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an 
atonement for a man's own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with 
rejoicings and feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or 
unjust, at a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as 
they say, to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they 
appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00579>Vice may be had in 
abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and her dwelling-place is near. But 
before virtue the gods have set toil,</P>
<P id=id00580>and a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that 
the gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00581>The gods, too, may he 
turned from their purpose; and men pray to them and avert their wrath by 
sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by libations and the odour of fat, when 
they have sinned and transgressed.</P>
<P id=id00582>And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, 
who were children of the Moon and the Muses—that is what they say—according to 
which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals, but whole 
cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and 
amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at the service of the 
living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries, and they redeem us 
from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us.</P>
<P id=id00583>He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about 
virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their 
minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,—those of them, I mean, who are 
quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all 
that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they 
should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life? 
Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of Pindar—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00584>Can I by justice or by 
crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all 
my days?</P>
<P id=id00585>For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also 
thought just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are 
unmistakable. But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of justice, a 
heavenly life is promised to me. Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance 
tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote 
myself. I will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the 
vestibule and exterior of my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty 
fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages, recommends. But I hear some one 
exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult; to which I 
answer, Nothing great is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we 
would be happy, to be the path along which we should proceed. With a view to 
concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there 
are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and 
assemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make 
unlawful gains and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods 
cannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled. But what if there are no 
gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human things—why in either case should 
we mind about concealment? And even if there are gods, and they do care about 
us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets; 
and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 
'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent 
then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak truly, why then we had 
better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if we are just, 
although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall lose the gains of 
injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep the gains, and by our sinning 
and praying, and praying and sinning, the gods will be propitiated, and we shall 
not be punished. 'But there is a world below in which either we or our posterity 
will suffer for our unjust deeds.' Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but 
there are mysteries and atoning deities, and these have great power. That is 
what mighty cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets 
and prophets, bear a like testimony.</P>
<P id=id00586>On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather 
than the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful 
regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men, in life 
and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us. 
Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority of mind or 
person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed to refrain 
from laughing when he hears justice praised? And even if there should be some 
one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that 
justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to 
forgive them, because he also knows that men are not just of their own free 
will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may 
have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge of the 
truth—but no other man. He only blames injustice who, owing to cowardice or age 
or some weakness, has not the power of being unjust. And this is proved by the 
fact that when he obtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he 
can be.</P>
<P id=id00587>The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the 
beginning of the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were 
to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice—beginning with the 
ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending with 
the men of our own time—no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice 
except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which flow from them. 
No one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential 
nature of either of them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or 
divine eye; or shown that of all the things of a man's soul which he has within 
him, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had this 
been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth 
upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing 
wrong, but every one would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did 
wrong, of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I dare say that 
Thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which I have been 
merely repeating, and words even stronger than these about justice and 
injustice, grossly, as I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in 
this vehement manner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear 
from you the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority 
which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the possessor of 
them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him. And please, 
as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations; for unless you take away 
from each of them his true reputation and add on the false, we shall say that 
you do not praise justice, but the appearance of it; we shall think that you are 
only exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with 
Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's good and the interest of the 
stronger, and that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though 
injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted that justice is one of that 
highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results, but in a far 
greater degree for their own sakes—like sight or hearing or knowledge or health, 
or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good—I would ask you 
in your praise of justice to regard one point only: I mean the essential good 
and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others 
praise justice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the 
one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, 
I am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the 
consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your own lips, I 
expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove to us that justice 
is better than injustice, but show what they either of them do to the possessor 
of them, which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil, whether seen or 
unseen by gods and men.</P>
<H5 id=id00588>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS</H5>
<P id=id00589>I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on 
hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an illustrious 
father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the admirer of 
Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the 
battle of Megara:—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00590>'Sons of Ariston,' he 
sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.'</P>
<P id=id00591>The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly 
divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice, 
and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that you are 
not convinced—this I infer from your general character, for had I judged only 
from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now, the greater my 
confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say. For I am 
in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that I am unequal to the task; 
and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied 
with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the 
superiority which justice has over injustice. And yet I cannot refuse to help, 
while breath and speech remain to me; I am afraid that there would be an impiety 
in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her 
defence. And therefore I had best give such help as I can.</P>
<P id=id00592>Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the 
question drop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the 
truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly, about 
their relative advantages. I told them, what I really thought, that the enquiry 
would be of a serious nature, and would require very good eyes. Seeing then, I 
said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had better adopt a method which 
I may illustrate thus; suppose that a short-sighted person had been asked by 
some one to read small letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else 
that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the 
letters were larger—if they were the same and he could read the larger letters 
first, and then proceed to the lesser—this would have been thought a rare piece 
of good fortune.</P>
<P id=id00593>Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to 
our enquiry?</P>
<P id=id00594>I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our 
enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, 
and sometimes as the virtue of a State.</P>
<P id=id00595>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00596>And is not a State larger than an individual?</P>
<P id=id00597>It is.</P>
<P id=id00598>Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger 
and more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature 
of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly in the 
individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them.</P>
<P id=id00599>That, he said, is an excellent proposal.</P>
<P id=id00600>And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see 
the justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.</P>
<P id=id00601>I dare say.</P>
<P id=id00602>When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of 
our search will be more easily discovered.</P>
<P id=id00603>Yes, far more easily.</P>
<P id=id00604>But ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as 
I am inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.</P>
<P id=id00605>I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should 
proceed.</P>
<P id=id00606>A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of 
mankind; no one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other 
origin of a State be imagined?</P>
<P id=id00607>There can I be no other.</P>
<P id=id00608>Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply 
them, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when these 
partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of 
inhabitants is termed a State.</P>
<P id=id00609>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id00610>And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another 
receives, under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.</P>
<P id=id00611>Very true.</P>
<P id=id00612>Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the 
true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.</P>
<P id=id00613>Of course, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00614>Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the 
condition of life and existence.</P>
<P id=id00615>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00616>The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.</P>
<P id=id00617>True.</P>
<P id=id00618>And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great 
demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one 
else a weaver—shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some other purveyor 
to our bodily wants?</P>
<P id=id00619>Quite right.</P>
<P id=id00620>The barest notion of a State must include four or five men.</P>
<P id=id00621>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id00622>And how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his 
labours into a common stock?—the individual husbandman, for example, producing 
for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the 
provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or will he 
have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, 
but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and 
in the remaining three-fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a 
coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying 
himself all his own wants?</P>
<P id=id00623>Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and 
not at producing everything.</P>
<P id=id00624>Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear 
you say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are 
diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations.</P>
<P id=id00625>Very true.</P>
<P id=id00626>And will you have a work better done when the workman has many 
occupations, or when he has only one?</P>
<P id=id00627>When he has only one.</P>
<P id=id00628>Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done 
at the right time?</P>
<P id=id00629>No doubt.</P>
<P id=id00630>For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the 
business is at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make 
the business his first object.</P>
<P id=id00631>He must.</P>
<P id=id00632>And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more 
plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which 
is natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.</P>
<P id=id00633>Undoubtedly..</P>
<P id=id00634>Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman 
will not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture, if 
they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make his tools—and he 
too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker.</P>
<P id=id00635>True.</P>
<P id=id00636>Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be 
sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?</P>
<P id=id00637>True.</P>
<P id=id00638>Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in 
order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well as 
husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces and 
hides,—still our State will not be very large.</P>
<P id=id00639>That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which 
contains all these.</P>
<P id=id00640>Then, again, there is the situation of the city—to find a place 
where nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible.</P>
<P id=id00641>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id00642>Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the 
required supply from another city?</P>
<P id=id00643>There must.</P>
<P id=id00644>But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they 
require who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.</P>
<P id=id00645>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id00646>And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough 
for themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those 
from whom their wants are supplied.</P>
<P id=id00647>Very true.</P>
<P id=id00648>Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?</P>
<P id=id00649>They will.</P>
<P id=id00650>Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called 
merchants?</P>
<P id=id00651>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00652>Then we shall want merchants?</P>
<P id=id00653>We shall.</P>
<P id=id00654>And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors 
will also be needed, and in considerable numbers?</P>
<P id=id00655>Yes, in considerable numbers.</P>
<P id=id00656>Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their 
productions?<BR>To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of 
our<BR>principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted 
a<BR>State.<BR></P>
<P id=id00657>Clearly they will buy and sell.</P>
<P id=id00658>Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes 
of exchange.</P>
<P id=id00659>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00660>Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some 
production to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange 
with him,—is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?</P>
<P id=id00661>Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, 
undertake the office of salesmen. In well-ordered States they are commonly those 
who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for any 
other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money in exchange 
for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to 
buy.</P>
<P id=id00662>This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. 
Is not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place 
engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to another 
are called merchants?</P>
<P id=id00663>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id00664>And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually 
hardly on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength 
for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not mistake, 
hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour.</P>
<P id=id00665>True.</P>
<P id=id00666>Then hirelings will help to make up our population?</P>
<P id=id00667>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00668>And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?</P>
<P id=id00669>I think so.</P>
<P id=id00670>Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part 
of the State did they spring up?</P>
<P id=id00671>Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. 
cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else.</P>
<P id=id00672>I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had 
better think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.</P>
<P id=id00673>Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of 
life, now that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and 
wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And when they are 
housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, but in 
winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed on barley-meal and flour 
of wheat, baking and kneading them, making noble cakes and loaves; these they 
will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves, themselves reclining the 
while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle. And they and their children will 
feast, drinking of the wine which they have made, wearing garlands on their 
heads, and hymning the praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another. 
And they will take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an 
eye to poverty or war.</P>
<H5 id=id00674>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id00675>But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish 
to their meal.</P>
<P id=id00676>True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a 
relish-salt, and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as 
country people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and peas, and 
beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at the fire, drinking in 
moderation. And with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and 
health to a good old age, and bequeath a similar life to their children after 
them.</P>
<P id=id00677>Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of 
pigs, how else would you feed the beasts?</P>
<P id=id00678>But what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.</P>
<P id=id00679>Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of 
life. People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and dine 
off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style.</P>
<P id=id00680>Yes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have 
me consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created; and 
possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be more likely 
to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion the true and healthy 
constitution of the State is the one which I have described. But if you wish 
also to see a State at fever heat, I have no objection. For I suspect that many 
will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way They will be for adding sofas, 
and tables, and other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and 
courtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every variety; we 
must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first speaking, such as houses, 
and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to 
be set in motion, and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be 
procured.</P>
<P id=id00681>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id00682>Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State 
is no longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a 
multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such as the 
whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have to do with forms 
and colours; another will be the votaries of music—poets and their attendant 
train of rhapsodists, players, dancers, contractors; also makers of divers kinds 
of articles, including women's dresses. And we shall want more servants. Will 
not tutors be also in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as 
well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and 
therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are needed now? 
They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals of many other kinds, if 
people eat them.</P>
<P id=id00683>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00684>And living in this way we shall have much greater need of 
physicians than before?</P>
<P id=id00685>Much greater.</P>
<P id=id00686>And the country which was enough to support the original 
inhabitants will be too small now, and not enough?</P>
<P id=id00687>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id00688>Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for 
pasture and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, 
they exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited 
accumulation of wealth?</P>
<P id=id00689>That, Socrates, will be inevitable.</P>
<P id=id00690>And so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?</P>
<P id=id00691>Most certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00692>Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, 
thus much we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from 
causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private as 
well as public.</P>
<P id=id00693>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id00694>And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the will be 
nothing short of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight with the 
invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and persons whom we 
were describing above.</P>
<P id=id00695>Why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?</P>
<P id=id00696>No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was 
acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you 
will remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.</P>
<P id=id00697>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00698>But is not war an art?</P>
<P id=id00699>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00700>And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?</P>
<P id=id00701>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id00702>And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman, or a 
weaver, a builder—in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to him 
and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature 
fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no 
other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would become a good 
workman. Now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier 
should be well done. But is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a 
warrior who is also a husbandman, or shoemaker, or other artisan; although no 
one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the 
game as a recreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to 
this and nothing else?</P>
<P id=id00703>No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, 
nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has never 
bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up a shield or 
other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day, whether with 
heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?</P>
<P id=id00704>Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would 
be beyond price.</P>
<P id=id00705>And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, 
and skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?</P>
<P id=id00706>No doubt, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00707>Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?</P>
<P id=id00708>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00709>Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are 
fitted for the task of guarding the city?</P>
<P id=id00710>It will.</P>
<P id=id00711>And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be 
brave and do our best.</P>
<P id=id00712>We must.</P>
<P id=id00713>Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of 
guarding and watching?</P>
<P id=id00714>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id00715>I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to 
overtake the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught 
him, they have to fight with him.</P>
<P id=id00716>All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by 
them.</P>
<P id=id00717>Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?</P>
<P id=id00718>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00719>And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or 
dog or any other animal? Have you never observed how invincible and 
unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any 
creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?</P>
<P id=id00720>I have.</P>
<P id=id00721>Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are 
required in the guardian.</P>
<P id=id00722>True.</P>
<P id=id00723>And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?</P>
<P id=id00724>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00725>But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one 
another, and with everybody else?</P>
<P id=id00726>A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00727>Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and 
gentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting 
for their enemies to destroy them.</P>
<P id=id00728>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id00729>What is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature 
which has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the 
other?</P>
<P id=id00730>True.</P>
<P id=id00731>He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these 
two qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and 
hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.</P>
<P id=id00732>I am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00733>Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded. My 
friend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost sight of 
the image which we had before us.</P>
<P id=id00734>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id00735>I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those 
opposite qualities.</P>
<P id=id00736>And where do you find them?</P>
<P id=id00737>Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the 
dog is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to 
their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.</P>
<P id=id00738>Yes, I know.</P>
<P id=id00739>Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in 
our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?</P>
<P id=id00740>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00741>Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited 
nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?</P>
<P id=id00742>I do not apprehend your meaning.</P>
<P id=id00743>The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in 
the dog, and is remarkable in the animal.</P>
<P id=id00744>What trait?</P>
<P id=id00745>Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an 
acquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor 
the other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?</P>
<P id=id00746>The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth 
of your remark.</P>
<P id=id00747>And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;—your dog is 
a true philosopher.</P>
<P id=id00748>Why?</P>
<P id=id00749>Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy 
only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal be a 
lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of 
knowledge and ignorance?</P>
<P id=id00750>Most assuredly.</P>
<P id=id00751>And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is 
philosophy?</P>
<P id=id00752>They are the same, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00753>And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely 
to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of 
wisdom and knowledge?</P>
<P id=id00754>That we may safely affirm.</P>
<P id=id00755>Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State 
will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and 
strength?</P>
<P id=id00756>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id00757>Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found 
them, how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this enquiry which may be 
expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end—How do 
justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not want either to omit what 
is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length.</P>
<H5 id=id00758>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS</H5>
<P id=id00759>Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to 
us.</P>
<P id=id00760>Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even 
if somewhat long.</P>
<P id=id00761>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00762>Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and 
our story shall be the education of our heroes.</P>
<P id=id00763>By all means.</P>
<P id=id00764>And what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the 
traditional sort?—and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and music 
for the soul.</P>
<P id=id00765>True.</P>
<P id=id00766>Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic 
afterwards?</P>
<P id=id00767>By all means.</P>
<P id=id00768>And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?</P>
<P id=id00769>I do.</P>
<P id=id00770>And literature may be either true or false?</P>
<P id=id00771>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00772>And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with 
the false?</P>
<P id=id00773>I do not understand your meaning, he said.</P>
<P id=id00774>You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which, 
though not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and these 
stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics.</P>
<P id=id00775>Very true.</P>
<P id=id00776>That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before 
gymnastics.</P>
<P id=id00777>Quite right, he said.</P>
<P id=id00778>You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any 
work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time 
at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more 
readily taken.</P>
<P id=id00779>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id00780>And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual 
tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds 
ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to 
have when they are grown up?</P>
<P id=id00781>We cannot.</P>
<P id=id00782>Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the 
writers of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is 
good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their 
children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such tales, 
even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but most of those 
which are now in use must be discarded.</P>
<P id=id00783>Of what tales are you speaking? he said.</P>
<P id=id00784>You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for 
they are necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of 
them.</P>
<P id=id00785>Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would 
term the greater.</P>
<P id=id00786>Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the 
rest of the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.</P>
<P id=id00787>But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find 
with them?</P>
<P id=id00788>A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, 
and, what is more, a bad lie.</P>
<P id=id00789>But when is this fault committed?</P>
<P id=id00790>Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods 
and heroes,—as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a 
likeness to the original.</P>
<P id=id00791>Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but 
what are the stories which you mean?</P>
<P id=id00792>First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high 
places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,—I mean 
what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on him. The doings 
of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him, even if 
they were true, ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless 
persons; if possible, they had better be buried in silence. But if there is an 
absolute necessity for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, 
and they should sacrifice not a common [Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and 
unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few 
indeed.</P>
<P id=id00793>Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.</P>
<P id=id00794>Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; 
the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is 
far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his father 
when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following the example of 
the first and greatest among the gods.</P>
<P id=id00795>I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories 
are quite unfit to be repeated.</P>
<P id=id00796>Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of 
quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word be 
said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of the gods 
against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never mention the 
battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments; and we shall be 
silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their 
friends and relatives. If they would only believe us we would tell them that 
quarrelling is unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any, 
quarrel between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by 
telling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told to 
compose for them in a similar spirit. But the narrative of Hephaestus binding 
Here his mother, or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking her 
part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of the gods in Homer—these 
tales must not be admitted into our State, whether they are supposed to have an 
allegorical meaning or not. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical 
and what is literal; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is 
likely to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important 
that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous 
thoughts.</P>
<P id=id00797>There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are 
such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking—how shall we answer 
him?</P>
<P id=id00798>I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not 
poets, but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the 
general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which must 
be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business.</P>
<P id=id00799>Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you 
mean?</P>
<P id=id00800>Something of this kind, I replied:—God is always to be represented 
as he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in which 
the representation is given.</P>
<P id=id00801>Right.</P>
<P id=id00802>And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as 
such?</P>
<P id=id00803>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00804>And no good thing is hurtful?</P>
<P id=id00805>No, indeed.</P>
<P id=id00806>And that which is not hurtful hurts not?</P>
<P id=id00807>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id00808>And that which hurts not does no evil?</P>
<P id=id00809>No.</P>
<P id=id00810>And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?</P>
<P id=id00811>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id00812>And the good is advantageous?</P>
<P id=id00813>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00814>And therefore the cause of well-being?</P>
<P id=id00815>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00816>It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, 
but of the good only?</P>
<P id=id00817>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id00818>Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the 
many assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things 
that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the evils, 
and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the causes are to be 
sought elsewhere, and not in him.</P>
<P id=id00819>That appears to me to be most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00820>Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is 
guilty of the folly of saying that two casks</P>
<P id=id00821>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of 
lots, one of good,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other of evil lots,<BR></P>
<P id=id00822>and that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two</P>
<P id=id00823>Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;</P>
<P id=id00824>but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,</P>
<P id=id00825>Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth.</P>
<P id=id00826>And again</P>
<P id=id00827>Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.</P>
<P id=id00828>And if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, 
which was really the work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus, or 
that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and Zeus, he 
shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our young men to hear the 
words of Aeschylus, that</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00829>God plants guilt among 
men when he desires utterly to destroy a house.</P>
<P id=id00830>And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe—the subject of the 
tragedy in which these iambic verses occur—or of the house of Pelops, or of the 
Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit him to say that 
these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he must devise some 
explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say that God did what was 
just and right, and they were the better for being punished; but that those who 
are punished are miserable, and that God is the author of their misery—the poet 
is not to be permitted to say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable 
because they require to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment 
from God; but that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be 
strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any 
one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth. Such a fiction is 
suicidal, ruinous, impious.</P>
<P id=id00831>I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to 
the law.</P>
<P id=id00832>Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the 
gods, to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform—that God is 
not the author of all things, but of good only.</P>
<P id=id00833>That will do, he said.</P>
<P id=id00834>And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you 
whether God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one 
shape, and now in another—sometimes himself changing and passing into many 
forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is 
he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?</P>
<P id=id00835>I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.</P>
<P id=id00836>Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change 
must be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?</P>
<P id=id00837>Most certainly.</P>
<P id=id00838>And things which are at their best are also least liable to be 
altered or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human 
frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which is 
in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or 
any similar causes.</P>
<P id=id00839>Of course.</P>
<P id=id00840>And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or 
deranged by any external influence?</P>
<P id=id00841>True.</P>
<P id=id00842>And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all 
composite things—furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they are 
least altered by time and circumstances.</P>
<P id=id00843>Very true.</P>
<P id=id00844>Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or 
both, is least liable to suffer change from without?</P>
<P id=id00845>True.</P>
<P id=id00846>But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?</P>
<P id=id00847>Of course they are.</P>
<P id=id00848>Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many 
shapes?</P>
<P id=id00849>He cannot.</P>
<P id=id00850>But may he not change and transform himself?</P>
<P id=id00851>Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at 
all.</P>
<P id=id00852>And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for 
the worse and more unsightly?</P>
<P id=id00853>If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we 
cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.</P>
<P id=id00854>Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or 
man, desire to make himself worse?</P>
<P id=id00855>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id00856>Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; 
being, as is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god 
remains absolutely and for ever in his own form.</P>
<P id=id00857>That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.</P>
<P id=id00858>Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us 
that</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00859>The gods, taking the 
disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up and down cities in all sorts of 
forms;</P>
<P id=id00860>and let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, 
either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in 
the likeness of a priestess asking an alms</P>
<P id=id00861>For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos;</P>
<P id=id00862>—let us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have 
mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad 
version of these myths—telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about by night 
in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms'; but let them take 
heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the same time speak 
blasphemy against the gods.</P>
<P id=id00863>Heaven forbid, he said.</P>
<P id=id00864>But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by 
witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various 
forms?</P>
<P id=id00865>Perhaps, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00866>Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether 
in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?</P>
<P id=id00867>I cannot say, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00868>Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression 
may be allowed, is hated of gods and men?</P>
<P id=id00869>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id00870>I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the 
truest and highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; 
there, above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.</P>
<P id=id00871>Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.</P>
<P id=id00872>The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning 
to my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or 
uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves, which 
is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie, is what 
mankind least like;—that, I say, is what they utterly detest.</P>
<P id=id00873>There is nothing more hateful to them.</P>
<P id=id00874>And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of 
him who is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a 
kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul, not 
pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?</P>
<P id=id00875>Perfectly right.</P>
<P id=id00876>The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?</P>
<P id=id00877>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00878>Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not 
hateful; in dealing with enemies—that would be an instance; or again, when those 
whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some 
harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also in the 
tales of mythology, of which we were just now speaking—because we do not know 
the truth about ancient times, we make falsehood as much like truth as we can, 
and so turn it to account.</P>
<P id=id00879>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00880>But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he 
is ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?</P>
<P id=id00881>That would be ridiculous, he said.</P>
<P id=id00882>Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?</P>
<P id=id00883>I should say not.</P>
<P id=id00884>Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?</P>
<P id=id00885>That is inconceivable.</P>
<P id=id00886>But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?</P>
<P id=id00887>But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.</P>
<P id=id00888>Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?</P>
<P id=id00889>None whatever.</P>
<P id=id00890>Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of 
falsehood?</P>
<P id=id00891>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00892>Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he 
changes not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking 
vision.</P>
<P id=id00893>Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.</P>
<P id=id00894>You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or 
form in which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not 
magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in any 
way.</P>
<P id=id00895>I grant that.</P>
<P id=id00896>Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the 
lying dream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses of 
Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00897>Was celebrating in song 
her fair progeny whose days were to be long, and to know no sickness. And when 
he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of 
triumph and cheered my soul. And I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine 
and full of prophecy, would not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain, 
he who was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has slain my 
son.</P>
<P id=id00898>These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse 
our anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall we 
allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young, meaning, as 
we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be true worshippers of 
the gods and like them.</P>
<P id=id00899>I entirely agree, be said, in these principles, and promise to 
make them my laws.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id00900>BOOK III</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id00901>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS</H4>
<P id=id00902>SUCH then, I said, are our principles of theology—some tales are 
to be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth 
upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to value 
friendship with one another.</P>
<P id=id00903>Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.</P>
<P id=id00904>But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other 
lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of 
death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?</P>
<P id=id00905>Certainly not, he said.</P>
<P id=id00906>And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle 
rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and 
terrible?</P>
<P id=id00907>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id00908>Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of 
tales as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather to 
commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue, 
and will do harm to our future warriors.</P>
<P id=id00909>That will be our duty, he said.</P>
<P id=id00910>Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages, 
beginning with the verses,</P>
<P id=id00911>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather he a serf on the land of a 
poor and portionless<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man than rule over all the dead 
who have come to nought.<BR></P>
<P id=id00912>We must also expunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto 
feared,</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00913>Lest the mansions grim 
and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen both of mortals and 
immortals.</P>
<P id=id00914>And again:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00915>O heavens! verily in the 
house of Hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all!</P>

<P id=id00918>Again:—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00919>The soul flying from the 
limbs had gone to Hades, lamentng her fate, leaving manhood and youth.</P>
<P id=id00920>Again:—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00921>And the soul, with 
shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the earth.</P>
<P id=id00922>And,—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00923>As bats in hollow of 
mystic cavern, whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from 
the rock, fly shrilling and cling to one another, so did they with shrilling cry 
hold together as they moved.</P>
<P id=id00924>And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we 
strike out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or 
unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical charm of 
them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be 
free, and who should fear slavery more than death.</P>
<P id=id00925>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id00926>Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names 
describe the world below—Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and sapless 
shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass 
through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do not say that these horrible 
stories may not have a use of some kind; but there is a danger that the nerves 
of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them.</P>
<P id=id00927>There is a real danger, he said.</P>
<P id=id00928>Then we must have no more of them.</P>
<P id=id00929>True.</P>
<P id=id00930>Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.</P>
<P id=id00931>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id00932>And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of 
famous men?</P>
<P id=id00933>They will go with the rest.</P>
<P id=id00934>But shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our 
principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other 
good man who is his comrade.</P>
<P id=id00935>Yes; that is our principle.</P>
<P id=id00936>And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though 
he had suffered anything terrible?</P>
<P id=id00937>He will not.</P>
<P id=id00938>Such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and 
his own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.</P>
<P id=id00939>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id00940>And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the 
deprivation of fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.</P>
<P id=id00941>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id00942>And therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear 
with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall 
him.</P>
<P id=id00943>Yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.</P>
<P id=id00944>Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of 
famous men, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good 
for anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being educated by 
us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like.</P>
<P id=id00945>That will be very right.</P>
<P id=id00946>Then we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to 
depict Achilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on 
his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along 
the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and 
pouring them over his head, or weeping and wailing in the various modes which 
Homer has delineated. Nor should he describe Priam the kinsman of the gods as 
praying and beseeching,</P>
<P id=id00947>Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.</P>
<P id=id00948>Still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to 
introduce the gods lamenting and saying,</P>
<P id=id00949>Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the harvest to my sorrow.</P>
<P id=id00950>But if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so 
completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him say—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00951>O heavens! with my eyes 
verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city, and my 
heart is sorrowful.</P>
<P id=id00952>Or again:—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00953>Woe is me that I am 
fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to me, subdued at the hands of Patroclus 
the son of Menoetius.</P>
<P id=id00954>For if, my sweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such 
unworthy representations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought, 
hardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a man, can be 
dishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination which may 
arise in his mind to say and do the like. And instead of having any shame or 
self-control, he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions.</P>
<P id=id00955>Yes, he said, that is most true.</P>
<P id=id00956>Yes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the 
argument has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is 
disproved by a better.</P>
<P id=id00957>It ought not to be.</P>
<P id=id00958>Neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of 
laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent 
reaction.</P>
<P id=id00959>So I believe.</P>
<P id=id00960>Then persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be 
represented as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation 
of the gods be allowed.</P>
<P id=id00961>Still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.</P>
<P id=id00962>Then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the 
gods as that of Homer when he describes how</P>
<P id=id00963>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inextinguishable laughter arose among the 
blessed gods, when<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they saw Hephaestus bustling about 
the mansion.<BR></P>
<P id=id00964>On your views, we must not admit them.</P>
<P id=id00965>On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not 
admit them is certain.</P>
<P id=id00966>Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie 
is useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use of 
such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private individuals have no 
business with them.</P>
<P id=id00967>Clearly not, he said.</P>
<P id=id00968>Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the 
rulers of the State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either 
with enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the public 
good. But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind; and although the 
rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to them in return is to be 
deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not 
to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the 
trainer, or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the 
ship and the rest of the crew, and how things are going with himself or his 
fellow sailors.</P>
<P id=id00969>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id00970>If, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the 
State,</P>
<P id=id00971>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of the craftsmen, whether he priest or 
physician or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carpenter.<BR></P>
<P id=id00972>he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally 
subversive and destructive of ship or State.</P>
<P id=id00973>Most certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried 
out.</P>
<P id=id00974>In the next place our youth must be temperate?</P>
<P id=id00975>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id00976>Are not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, 
obedience to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?</P>
<P id=id00977>True.</P>
<P id=id00978>Then we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in 
Homer,</P>
<P id=id00979>Friend, sit still and obey my word,</P>
<P id=id00980>and the verses which follow,</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00981>The Greeks marched 
breathing prowess, …in silent awe of their leaders,</P>
<P id=id00982>and other sentiments of the same kind.</P>
<P id=id00983>We shall.</P>
<P id=id00984>What of this line,</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00985>O heavy with wine, who 
hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag,</P>
<P id=id00986>and of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any 
similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their 
rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?</P>
<P id=id00987>They are ill spoken.</P>
<P id=id00988>They may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not 
conduce to temperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young 
men—you would agree with me there?</P>
<P id=id00989>Yes.</P>
<P id=id00990>And then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his 
opinion is more glorious than</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id00991>When the tables are full 
of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries round wine which he draws from the 
bowl and pours into the cups,</P>
<P id=id00992>is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such 
words? Or the verse</P>
<P id=id00993>The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?</P>
<P id=id00994>What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other 
gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but 
forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at 
the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with 
her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture 
before, even when they first met one another</P>
<P id=id00995>Without the knowledge of their parents;</P>
<P id=id00996>or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings 
on, cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?</P>
<P id=id00997>Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to 
hear that sort of thing.</P>
<P id=id00998>But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, 
these they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the 
verses,</P>
<P id=id00999>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smote his breast, and thus reproached 
his heart,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou 
endured!<BR></P>
<P id=id01000>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id01001>In the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or 
lovers of money.</P>
<P id=id01002>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01003>Neither must we sing to them of</P>
<P id=id01004>Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.</P>
<P id=id01005>Neither is Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or 
deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take 
the gifts of the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he should not 
lay aside his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge Achilles himself to 
have been such a lover of money that he took Agamemnon's or that when he had 
received payment he restored the dead body of Hector, but that without payment 
he was unwilling to do so.</P>
<P id=id01006>Undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be 
approved.</P>
<P id=id01007>Loving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing 
these feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him, he is 
guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the narrative of his 
insolence to Apollo, where he says,</P>
<P id=id01008>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most 
abominable of deities.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verily I would he even with 
thee, if I had only the power,<BR></P>
<P id=id01009>or his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is 
ready to lay hands; or his offering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair, which 
had been previously dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius, and that he 
actually performed this vow; or that he dragged Hector round the tomb of 
Patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre; of all this I cannot 
believe that he was guilty, any more than I can allow our citizens to believe 
that he, the wise Cheiron's pupil, the son of a goddess and of Peleus who was 
the gentlest of men and third in descent from Zeus, was so disordered in his 
wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, 
meanness, not untainted by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods 
and men.</P>
<P id=id01010>You are quite right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01011>And let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the 
tale of Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going forth as 
they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of a god 
daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in 
our day: and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts 
were not done by them, or that they were not the sons of gods;—both in the same 
breath they shall not be permitted to affirm. We will not have them trying to 
persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no 
better than men-sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious nor true, 
for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods.</P>
<P id=id01012>Assuredly not.</P>
<P id=id01013>And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear 
them; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that 
similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by—</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id01014>The kindred of the gods, 
the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral altar, the attar of Zeus, is aloft in air 
on the peak of Ida,</P>
<P id=id01015>and who have</P>
<P id=id01016>the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins.</P>
<P id=id01017>And therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender 
laxity of morals among the young.</P>
<P id=id01018>By all means, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01019>But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or 
are not to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The 
manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be 
treated has been already laid down.</P>
<P id=id01020>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01021>And what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining 
portion of our subject.</P>
<P id=id01022>Clearly so.</P>
<P id=id01023>But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, 
my friend.</P>
<P id=id01024>Why not?</P>
<P id=id01025>Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men 
poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they 
tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable; and that 
injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a man's own loss 
and another's gain—these things we shall forbid them to utter, and command them 
to sing and say the opposite.</P>
<P id=id01026>To be sure we shall, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01027>But if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain 
that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along 
contending.</P>
<P id=id01028>I grant the truth of your inference.</P>
<P id=id01029>That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question 
which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and how 
naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems to be just or not.</P>
<P id=id01030>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01031>Enough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; 
and when this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been 
completely treated.</P>
<P id=id01032>I do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.</P>
<P id=id01033>Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more 
intelligible if I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all 
mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to 
come?</P>
<P id=id01034>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01035>And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a 
union of the two?</P>
<P id=id01036>That again, he said, I do not quite understand.</P>
<P id=id01037>I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much 
difficulty in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore, I will 
not take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in illustration of 
my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in which the poet says that 
Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a 
passion with him; whereupon Chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of 
the God against the Achaeans. Now as far as these lines,</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" id=id01038>And he prayed all the 
Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus, the chiefs of the people,</P>
<P id=id01039>the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to 
suppose that he is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of 
Chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is 
not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double form he has cast the 
entire narrative of the events which occurred at Troy and in Ithaca and 
throughout the Odyssey.</P>
<P id=id01040>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01041>And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet 
recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?</P>
<P id=id01042>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id01043>But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say 
that he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, is 
going to speak?</P>
<P id=id01044>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01045>And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of 
voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?</P>
<P id=id01046>Of course.</P>
<P id=id01047>Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed 
by way of imitation?</P>
<P id=id01048>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01049>Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, 
then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration. 
However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that you may no 
more say, I don't understand,' I will show how the change might be effected. If 
Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his daughter's ransom in his hands, 
supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the kings;' and then if, instead of 
speaking in the person of Chryses, he had continued in his own person, the words 
would have been, not imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have run 
as follows (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), 'The priest came and 
prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy and return 
safely home, but begged that they would give him back his daughter, and take the 
ransom which he brought, and respect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other 
Greeks revered the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him 
depart and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of 
no avail to him—the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he said—she 
should grow old with him in Argos. And then he told him to go away and not to 
provoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed. And the old man went away in 
fear and silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his 
many names, reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him, 
whether in building his temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his 
good deeds might be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his 
tears by the arrows of the god,'—and so on. In this way the whole becomes simple 
narrative.</P>
<P id=id01050>I understand, he said.</P>
<P id=id01051>Or you may suppose the opposite case—that the intermediate 
passages are omitted, and the dialogue only left.</P>
<P id=id01052>That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in 
tragedy.</P>
<P id=id01053>You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, 
what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and 
mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative—instances of this are supplied by 
tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style, in which the my poet 
is the only speaker—of this the dithyramb affords the best example; and the 
combination of both is found in epic, and in several other styles of poetry. Do 
I take you with me?</P>
<P id=id01054>Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.</P>
<P id=id01055>I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we 
had done with the subject and might proceed to the style.</P>
<P id=id01056>Yes, I remember.</P>
<P id=id01057>In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an 
understanding about the mimetic art,—whether the poets, in narrating their 
stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole or in 
part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation be 
prohibited?</P>
<P id=id01058>You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be 
admitted into our State?</P>
<P id=id01059>Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really 
do not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.</P>
<P id=id01060>And go we will, he said.</P>
<P id=id01061>Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be 
imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule already 
laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many; and that if he 
attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any?</P>
<P id=id01062>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01063>And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many 
things as well as he would imitate a single one?</P>
<P id=id01064>He cannot.</P>
<P id=id01065>Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in 
life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as 
well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same persons 
cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy and comedy—did 
you not just now call them imitations?</P>
<P id=id01066>Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons 
cannot succeed in both.</P>
<P id=id01067>Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?</P>
<P id=id01068>True.</P>
<P id=id01069>Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things 
are but imitations.</P>
<P id=id01070>They are so.</P>
<P id=id01071>And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet 
smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as of 
performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.</P>
<P id=id01072>Quite true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01073>If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our 
guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate themselves wholly 
to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making this their craft, and 
engaging in no work which does not bear on this end, they ought not to practise 
or imitate anything else; if they imitate at all, they should imitate from youth 
upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession—the 
courageous, temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or 
be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from 
imitation they should come to be what they imitate. Did you never observe how 
imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length 
grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and 
mind?</P>
<P id=id01074>Yes, certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id01075>Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care 
and of whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether 
young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting against the 
gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in affliction, or sorrow, or 
weeping; and certainly not one who is in sickness, love, or labour.</P>
<P id=id01076>Very right, he said.</P>
<P id=id01077>Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the 
offices of slaves?</P>
<P id=id01078>They must not.</P>
<P id=id01079>And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the 
reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or revile one 
another in drink or out of in drink or, or who in any other manner sin against 
themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the manner of such is. 
Neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women 
who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is to be known but not to be 
practised or imitated.</P>
<P id=id01080>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01081>Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, 
or boatswains, or the like?</P>
<P id=id01082>How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their 
minds to the callings of any of these?</P>
<P id=id01083>Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of 
bulls, the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of 
thing?</P>
<P id=id01084>Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the 
behaviour of madmen.</P>
<P id=id01085>You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one 
sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has 
anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite 
character and education.</P>
<P id=id01086>And which are these two sorts? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01087>Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a 
narration comes on some saying or action of another good man,—I should imagine 
that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this sort of 
imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is 
acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or 
love or drink, or has met with any other disaster. But when he comes to a 
character which is unworthy of him, he will not make a study of that; he will 
disdain such a person, and will assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment 
only when he is performing some good action; at other times he will be ashamed 
to play a part which he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and 
frame himself after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art, 
unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.</P>
<P id=id01088>So I should expect, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01089>Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated 
out of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and narrative; 
but there will be very little of the former, and a great deal of the latter. Do 
you agree?</P>
<P id=id01090>Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must 
necessarily take.</P>
<P id=id01091>But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, 
and, the worse lie is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too bad 
for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke, but in right 
good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now saying, he will 
attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of wind and hall, or the 
creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various sounds of flutes; pipes, 
trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will bark like a dog, bleat like a 
sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art will consist in imitation of voice 
and gesture, and there will be very little narration.</P>
<P id=id01092>That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.</P>
<P id=id01093>These, then, are the two kinds of style?</P>
<P id=id01094>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01095>And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple 
and has but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for 
their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks correctly, is 
always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep within the limits of a 
single harmony (for the changes are not great), and in like manner he will make 
use of nearly the same rhythm?</P>
<P id=id01096>That is quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01097>Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of 
rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style has all 
sorts of changes.</P>
<P id=id01098>That is also perfectly true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01099>And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend 
all poetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything 
except in one or other of them or in both together.</P>
<P id=id01100>They include all, he said.</P>
<P id=id01101>And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one 
only of the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?</P>
<P id=id01102>I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.</P>
<P id=id01103>Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very 
charming: and indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by 
you, is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with the 
world in general.</P>
<P id=id01104>I do not deny it.</P>
<P id=id01105>But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to 
our State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man plays 
one part only?</P>
<P id=id01106>Yes; quite unsuitable.</P>
<P id=id01107>And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we 
shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman 
to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not a 
trader also, and the same throughout?</P>
<P id=id01108>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id01109>And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are 
so clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal to 
exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and 
holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that in our State such as 
he are not permitted to exist; the law will not allow them. And so when we have 
anointed him with myrrh, and set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send 
him away to another city. For we mean to employ for our souls' health the 
rougher and severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the 
virtuous only, and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we 
began the education of our soldiers.</P>
<P id=id01110>We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.</P>
<P id=id01111>Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary 
education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; 
for the matter and manner have both been discussed.</P>
<P id=id01112>I think so too, he said.</P>
<P id=id01113>Next in order will follow melody and song.</P>
<P id=id01114>That is obvious.</P>
<P id=id01115>Every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we 
are to be consistent with ourselves.</P>
<H5 id=id01116>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id01117>I fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the words 'every one' hardly 
includes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though I may 
guess.</P>
<P id=id01118>At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts—the 
words, the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may 
presuppose?</P>
<P id=id01119>Yes, he said; so much as that you may.</P>
<P id=id01120>And as for the words, there surely be no difference words between 
words which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same 
laws, and these have been already determined by us?</P>
<P id=id01121>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01122>And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?</P>
<P id=id01123>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01124>We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had 
no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow?</P>
<P id=id01125>True.</P>
<P id=id01126>And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical, 
and can tell me.</P>
<P id=id01127>The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and 
the full-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.</P>
<P id=id01128>These then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a 
character to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men. Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01129>In the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are 
utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians.</P>
<P id=id01130>Utterly unbecoming.</P>
<P id=id01131>And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?</P>
<P id=id01132>The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 
'relaxed.'</P>
<P id=id01133>Well, and are these of any military use?</P>
<P id=id01134>Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the 
Phrygian are the only ones which you have left.</P>
<P id=id01135>I answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have 
one warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of 
danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he is going to 
wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at every such crisis 
meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure; and 
another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action, when there is 
no pressure of necessity, and he is seeking to persuade God by prayer, or man by 
instruction and admonition, or on the other hand, when he is expressing his 
willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which 
represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away 
by his success, but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances, and 
acquiescing in the event. These two harmonies I ask you to leave; the strain of 
necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the 
strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage, and the strain of temperance; 
these, I say, leave.</P>
<P id=id01136>And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of 
which I was just now speaking.</P>
<P id=id01137>Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs 
and melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic 
scale?</P>
<P id=id01138>I suppose not.</P>
<P id=id01139>Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three 
corners and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed 
curiously-harmonised instruments?</P>
<P id=id01140>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01141>But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you 
admit them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony 
the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together; even the 
panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?</P>
<P id=id01142>Clearly not.</P>
<P id=id01143>There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, 
and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country.</P>
<P id=id01144>That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.</P>
<P id=id01145>The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his 
instruments is not at all strange, I said.</P>
<P id=id01146>Not at all, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01147>And so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging 
the<BR>State, which not long ago we termed luxurious.<BR></P>
<P id=id01148>And we have done wisely, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01149>Then let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to 
harmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to the same 
rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre, or metres of every 
kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous 
and harmonious life; and when we have found them, we shall adapt the foot and 
the melody to words having a like spirit, not the words to the foot and melody. 
To say what these rhythms are will be your duty—you must teach me them, as you 
have already taught me the harmonies.</P>
<P id=id01150>But, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there 
are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed, 
just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are 
composed; that is an observation which I have made. But of what sort of lives 
they are severally the imitations I am unable to say.</P>
<P id=id01151>Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will 
tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or other 
unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite 
feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a 
complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic, and he arranged them in some 
manner which I do not quite understand, making the rhythms equal in the rise and 
fall of the foot, long and short alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he 
spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short 
and long quantities. Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the 
movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination of 
the two; for I am not certain what he meant. These matters, however, as I was 
saying, had better be referred to Damon himself, for the analysis of the subject 
would be difficult, you know.</P>
<P id=id01152>Rather so, I should say.</P>
<P id=id01153>But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of 
grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm.</P>
<P id=id01154>None at all.</P>
<P id=id01155>And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good 
and bad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style; for our 
principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words, and not the 
words by them.</P>
<P id=id01156>Just so, he said, they should follow the words.</P>
<P id=id01157>And will not the words and the character of the style depend on 
the temper of the soul?</P>
<P id=id01158>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01159>And everything else on the style?</P>
<P id=id01160>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01161>Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend 
on simplicity,—I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind 
and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for 
folly?</P>
<P id=id01162>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01163>And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make 
these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?</P>
<P id=id01164>They must.</P>
<P id=id01165>And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and 
constructive art are full of them,—weaving, embroidery, architecture, and every 
kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,—in all of them there is 
grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion 
are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature, as grace and harmony are the twin 
sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness.</P>
<P id=id01166>That is quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01167>But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets 
only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on 
pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the same 
control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be prohibited from 
exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and 
indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts; and is he who 
cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in 
our State, lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him? We would not have 
our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious 
pasture, and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by 
day, little by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption 
in their own soul. Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the 
true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our youth dwell in a land 
of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything; and 
beauty, the effluence of fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a 
health-giving breeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from 
earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.</P>
<P id=id01168>There can be no nobler training than that, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01169>And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent 
instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the 
inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and 
making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is 
ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has received this true 
education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in 
art and nature, and with a true taste, while he praises and rejoices over and 
receives into his soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly 
blame and hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to 
know the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the 
friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.</P>
<P id=id01170>Yes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth 
should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.</P>
<P id=id01171>Just as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we 
knew the letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring 
sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a 
space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out; and not thinking 
ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they 
are found:</P>
<P id=id01172>True—</P>
<P id=id01173>Or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in 
a mirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and study 
giving us the knowledge of both:</P>
<P id=id01174>Exactly—</P>
<P id=id01175>Even so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have 
to educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms, 
in all their combinations, and can recognise them and their images wherever they 
are found, not slighting them either in small things or great, but believing 
them all to be within the sphere of one art and study.</P>
<P id=id01176>Most assuredly.</P>
<P id=id01177>And when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form, and 
the two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has 
an eye to see it?</P>
<P id=id01178>The fairest indeed.</P>
<P id=id01179>And the fairest is also the loveliest?</P>
<P id=id01180>That may be assumed.</P>
<P id=id01181>And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love 
with the loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?</P>
<P id=id01182>That is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if 
there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it, and will 
love all the same.</P>
<P id=id01183>I perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this 
sort, and I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess of pleasure 
any affinity to temperance?</P>
<P id=id01184>How can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of 
his faculties quite as much as pain.</P>
<P id=id01185>Or any affinity to virtue in general?</P>
<P id=id01186>None whatever.</P>
<P id=id01187>Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?</P>
<P id=id01188>Yes, the greatest.</P>
<P id=id01189>And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual 
love?</P>
<P id=id01190>No, nor a madder.</P>
<P id=id01191>Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order—temperate and 
harmonious?</P>
<P id=id01192>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01193>Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true 
love?</P>
<P id=id01194>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01195>Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come 
near the lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their 
love is of the right sort?</P>
<P id=id01196>No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.</P>
<P id=id01197>Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would 
make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his 
love than a father would use to his son, and then only for a noble purpose, and 
he must first have the other's consent; and this rule is to limit him in all his 
intercourse, and he is never to be seen going further, or, if he exceeds, he is 
to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste.</P>
<P id=id01198>I quite agree, he said.</P>
<P id=id01199>Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be 
the end of music if not the love of beauty?</P>
<P id=id01200>I agree, he said.</P>
<P id=id01201>After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be 
trained.</P>
<P id=id01202>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01203>Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the 
training in it should be careful and should continue through life. Now my belief 
is,—and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion in 
confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,—not that the good body by any 
bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that the good soul, 
by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this may be possible. What do 
you say?</P>
<P id=id01204>Yes, I agree.</P>
<P id=id01205>Then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in 
handing over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid 
prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.</P>
<P id=id01206>Very good.</P>
<P id=id01207>That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked 
by us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not 
know where in the world he is.</P>
<P id=id01208>Yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to 
take care of him is ridiculous indeed.</P>
<P id=id01209>But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in 
training for the great contest of all—are they not?</P>
<P id=id01210>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id01211>And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to 
them?</P>
<P id=id01212>Why not?</P>
<P id=id01213>I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but 
a sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe that 
these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most dangerous 
illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from their customary 
regimen?</P>
<P id=id01214>Yes, I do.</P>
<P id=id01215>Then, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our 
warrior athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the 
utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of summer heat 
and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a campaign, they must 
not be liable to break down in health.</P>
<P id=id01216>That is my view.</P>
<P id=id01217>The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music 
which we were just now describing.</P>
<P id=id01218>How so?</P>
<P id=id01219>Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, 
is simple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.</P>
<P id=id01220>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id01221>My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his 
heroes at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have 
no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not 
allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for 
soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving the 
trouble of carrying about pots and pans.</P>
<P id=id01222>True.</P>
<P id=id01223>And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are 
nowhere mentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular; 
all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good 
condition should take nothing of the kind.</P>
<P id=id01224>Yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking 
them.</P>
<P id=id01225>Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the 
refinements of<BR>Sicilian cookery?<BR></P>
<P id=id01226>I think not.</P>
<P id=id01227>Nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have 
a<BR>Corinthian girl as his fair friend?<BR></P>
<P id=id01228>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01229>Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, 
of<BR>Athenian confectionery?<BR></P>
<P id=id01230>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01231>All such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to 
melody and song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms. 
Exactly.</P>
<P id=id01232>There complexity engendered license, and here disease; whereas 
simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and simplicity in 
gymnastic of health in the body.</P>
<P id=id01233>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01234>But when intemperance and disease multiply in a State, halls of 
justice and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor and the 
lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest which not only the 
slaves but the freemen of a city take about them.</P>
<P id=id01235>Of course.</P>
<P id=id01236>And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful 
state of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of 
people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who 
would profess to have had a liberal education? Is it not disgraceful, and a 
great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his 
law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore 
surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges 
over him?</P>
<P id=id01237>Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.</P>
<P id=id01238>Would you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is a 
further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long litigant, 
passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant, but is 
actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness; he imagines 
that he is a master in dishonesty; able to take every crooked turn, and wriggle 
into and out of every hole, bending like a withy and getting out of the way of 
justice: and all for what?—in order to gain small points not worth mentioning, 
he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping 
judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing. Is not that still more 
disgraceful?</P>
<P id=id01239>Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.</P>
<P id=id01240>Well, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a 
wound has to be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by 
indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill 
themselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh, compelling 
the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for diseases, such as 
flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?</P>
<P id=id01241>Yes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled 
names to diseases.</P>
<P id=id01242>Yes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such 
diseases in the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that 
the hero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of 
Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese, which are 
certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who were at the Trojan war 
do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or rebuke Patroclus, who is 
treating his case.</P>
<P id=id01243>Well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given 
to a person in his condition.</P>
<P id=id01244>Not so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in 
former days, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of 
Asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be said to 
educate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of a sickly 
constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of 
torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest of the world.</P>
<P id=id01245>How was that? he said.</P>
<P id=id01246>By the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease 
which he perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he passed 
his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but attend upon 
himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from 
his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help of science he struggled on to 
old age.</P>
<P id=id01247>A rare reward of his skill!</P>
<P id=id01248>Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never 
understood that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian 
arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of 
medicine, but because he knew that in all well-ordered states every individual 
has an occupation to which he must attend, and has therefore no leisure to spend 
in continually being ill. This we remark in the case of the artisan, but, 
ludicrously enough, do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort.</P>
<P id=id01249>How do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id01250>I mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a 
rough and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,—these are 
his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics, and 
tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and all that sort of thing, 
he replies at once that he has no time to be ill, and that he sees no good in a 
life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary 
employment; and therefore bidding good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes 
his ordinary habits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, 
if his constitution falls, he dies and has no more trouble.</P>
<P id=id01251>Yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the 
art of medicine thus far only.</P>
<P id=id01252>Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be 
in his life if he were deprived of his occupation?</P>
<P id=id01253>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01254>But with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that 
he has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would live.</P>
<P id=id01255>He is generally supposed to have nothing to do.</P>
<P id=id01256>Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as 
a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue?</P>
<P id=id01257>Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat 
sooner.</P>
<P id=id01258>Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather 
ask ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or can he 
live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a further question, 
whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of 
the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does not equally stand in 
the way of the sentiment of Phocylides?</P>
<P id=id01259>Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of 
the body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to the 
practice of virtue.</P>
<P id=id01260>Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the 
management of a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most 
important of all, irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or 
self-reflection—there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to 
be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in 
the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a man is always fancying that he is 
being made ill, and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body.</P>
<P id=id01261>Yes, likely enough.</P>
<P id=id01262>And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have 
exhibited the power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy 
constitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these he cured 
by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein consulting the 
interests of the State; but bodies which disease had penetrated through and 
through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation 
and infusion: he did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have 
weak fathers begetting weaker sons;—if a man was not able to live in the 
ordinary way he had no business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of 
no use either to himself, or to the State.</P>
<P id=id01263>Then, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.</P>
<P id=id01264>Clearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. 
Note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of 
which I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when Pandarus 
wounded Menelaus, they</P>
<P id=id01265>Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing 
remedies,</P>
<P id=id01266>but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat 
or drink in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus; the 
remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before he was 
wounded was healthy and regular in habits; and even though he did happen to 
drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all the same. But they would 
have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects, whose lives were of 
no use either to themselves or others; the art of medicine was not designed for 
their good, and though they were as rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would 
have declined to attend them.</P>
<P id=id01267>They were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.</P>
<P id=id01268>Naturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar 
disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the son of 
Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point 
of death, and for this reason he was struck by lightning. But we, in accordance 
with the principle already affirmed by us, will not believe them when they tell 
us both;—if he was the son of a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, 
if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god.</P>
<P id=id01269>All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a 
question to you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not 
the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and 
bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with 
all sorts of moral natures?</P>
<P id=id01270>Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But 
do you know whom I think good?</P>
<P id=id01271>Will you tell me?</P>
<P id=id01272>I will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question 
you join two things which are not the same.</P>
<P id=id01273>How so? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01274>Why, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful 
physicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with the 
knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they had better not 
be robust in health, and should have had all manner of diseases in their own 
persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the instrument with which they cure 
the body; in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been 
sickly; but they cure the body with the mind, and the mind which has become and 
is sick can cure nothing.</P>
<P id=id01275>That is very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01276>But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; 
he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to have 
associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through the whole 
calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others 
as he might their bodily diseases from his own self-consciousness; the 
honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no 
experience or contamination of evil habits when young. And this is the reason 
why in youth good men often appear to be simple, and are easily practised upon 
by the dishonest, because they have no examples of what evil is in their own 
souls.</P>
<P id=id01277>Yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.</P>
<P id=id01278>Therefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have 
learned to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation 
of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not personal 
experience.</P>
<P id=id01279>Yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.</P>
<P id=id01280>Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to 
your question); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and 
suspicious nature of which we spoke,—he who has committed many crimes, and 
fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst his fellows, is 
wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he judges of them by 
himself: but when he gets into the company of men of virtue, who have the 
experience of age, he appears to be a fool again, owing to his unseasonable 
suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man, because he has no pattern of 
honesty in himself; at the same time, as the bad are more numerous than the 
good, and he meets with them oftener, he thinks himself, and is by others 
thought to be, rather wise than foolish.</P>
<P id=id01281>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01282>Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, 
but the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature, educated 
by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the virtuous, and not 
the vicious, man has wisdom—in my opinion.</P>
<P id=id01283>And in mine also.</P>
<P id=id01284>This is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which 
you sanction in your State. They will minister to better natures, giving health 
both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will 
leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to 
themselves.</P>
<P id=id01285>That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the 
State.</P>
<P id=id01286>And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music 
which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.</P>
<P id=id01287>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01288>And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to 
practise the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless in 
some extreme case.</P>
<P id=id01289>That I quite believe.</P>
<P id=id01290>The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to 
stimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his strength; 
he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to develop his 
muscles.</P>
<P id=id01291>Very right, he said.</P>
<P id=id01292>Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, 
as is often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other fir the 
training of the body.</P>
<P id=id01293>What then is the real object of them?</P>
<P id=id01294>I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly 
the improvement of the soul.</P>
<P id=id01295>How can that be? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01296>Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of 
exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion 
to music?</P>
<P id=id01297>In what way shown? he said.</P>
<P id=id01298>The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of 
softness and effeminacy, I replied.</P>
<P id=id01299>Yes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too 
much of a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what 
is good for him.</P>
<P id=id01300>Yet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, 
if rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is liable 
to become hard and brutal.</P>
<P id=id01301>That I quite think.</P>
<P id=id01302>On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of 
gentleness. And this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, 
if educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.</P>
<P id=id01303>True.</P>
<P id=id01304>And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these 
qualities?</P>
<P id=id01305>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id01306>And both should be in harmony?</P>
<P id=id01307>Beyond question.</P>
<P id=id01308>And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?</P>
<P id=id01309>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01310>And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?</P>
<P id=id01311>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01312>And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his 
soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of 
which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in warbling and 
the delights of song; in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit 
which is in him is tempered like iron, and made useful, instead of brittle and 
useless. But, if he carries on the softening and soothing process, in the next 
stage he begins to melt and waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut 
out the sinews of his soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.</P>
<P id=id01313>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01314>If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is 
speedily accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music 
weakening the spirit renders him excitable;—on the least provocation he flames 
up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having spirit he grows 
irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.</P>
<P id=id01315>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id01316>And so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a 
great feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at 
first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit, and lie 
becomes twice the man that he was.</P>
<P id=id01317>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01318>And what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no con-a verse 
with the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, 
having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture, grow 
feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment, 
and his senses not being purged of their mists?</P>
<P id=id01319>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id01320>And he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never 
using the weapon of persuasion,—he is like a wild beast, all violence and 
fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all ignorance and 
evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.</P>
<P id=id01321>That is quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01322>And as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited 
and the other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given mankind 
two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and body), in order 
that these two principles (like the strings of an instrument) may be relaxed or 
drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised.</P>
<P id=id01323>That appears to be the intention.</P>
<P id=id01324>And he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest 
proportions, and best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true 
musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings.</P>
<P id=id01325>You are quite right, Socrates.</P>
<P id=id01326>And such a presiding genius will be always required in our State 
if the government is to last.</P>
<P id=id01327>Yes, he will be absolutely necessary.</P>
<P id=id01328>Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where 
would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, 
or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests? 
For these all follow the general principle, and having found that, we shall have 
no difficulty in discovering them.</P>
<P id=id01329>I dare say that there will be no difficulty.</P>
<P id=id01330>Very good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask 
who are to be rulers and who subjects?</P>
<P id=id01331>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01332>There can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.</P>
<P id=id01333>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01334>And that the best of these must rule.</P>
<P id=id01335>That is also clear.</P>
<P id=id01336>Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to 
husbandry?</P>
<P id=id01337>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01338>And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must 
they not be those who have most the character of guardians?</P>
<P id=id01339>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01340>And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a 
special care of the State?</P>
<P id=id01341>True.</P>
<P id=id01342>And a man will be most likely to care about that which he 
loves?</P>
<P id=id01343>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id01344>And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having 
the same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune is 
supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?</P>
<P id=id01345>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01346>Then there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians 
those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the 
good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her 
interests.</P>
<P id=id01347>Those are the right men.</P>
<P id=id01348>And they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we 
may see whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence 
either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the 
State.</P>
<P id=id01349>How cast off? he said.</P>
<P id=id01350>I will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a 
man's mind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he gets 
rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he is deprived 
of a truth.</P>
<P id=id01351>I understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the 
meaning of the unwilling I have yet to learn.</P>
<P id=id01352>Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of 
good, and willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to 
possess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things as they 
are is to possess the truth?</P>
<P id=id01353>Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are 
deprived of truth against their will.</P>
<P id=id01354>And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or 
force, or enchantment?</P>
<P id=id01355>Still, he replied, I do not understand you.</P>
<P id=id01356>I fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. 
I only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget; 
argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and this I 
call theft. Now you understand me?</P>
<P id=id01357>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01358>Those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some 
pain or grief compels to change their opinion.</P>
<P id=id01359>I understand, he said, and you are quite right.</P>
<P id=id01360>And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who 
change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner 
influence of fear?</P>
<P id=id01361>Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.</P>
<P id=id01362>Therefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the 
best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the 
State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from their youth 
upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget 
or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected, 
and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected. That will be the way?</P>
<P id=id01363>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01364>And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed 
for them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same 
qualities.</P>
<P id=id01365>Very right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01366>And then, I said, we must try them with enchantments that is the 
third sort of test—and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take 
colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so must we 
take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them into pleasures, 
and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace, that we may 
discover whether they are armed against all enchantments, and of a noble bearing 
always, good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned, 
and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such 
as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the State. And he who at 
every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial 
victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the State; he 
shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive sepulture and other 
memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to give. But him who fails, we 
must reject. I am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our 
rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed. I speak generally, and not 
with any pretension to exactness.</P>
<P id=id01367>And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.</P>
<P id=id01368>And perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be 
applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and 
maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have the will, 
or the others the power, to harm us. The young men whom we before called 
guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the 
principles of the rulers.</P>
<P id=id01369>I agree with you, he said.</P>
<P id=id01370>How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we 
lately spoke—just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that be 
possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?</P>
<P id=id01371>What sort of lie? he said.</P>
<P id=id01372>Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale of what has 
often occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made the 
world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know whether such an event 
could ever happen again, or could now even be made probable, if it did.</P>
<P id=id01373>How your words seem to hesitate on your lips!</P>
<P id=id01374>You will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have 
heard.</P>
<P id=id01375>Speak, he said, and fear not.</P>
<P id=id01376>Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look 
you in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which I 
propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, and 
lastly to the people. They are to be told that their youth was a dream, and the 
education and training which they received from us, an appearance only; in 
reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the 
earth, where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; 
when they were completed, the earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their 
country being their mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for 
her good, and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard 
as children of the earth and their own brothers.</P>
<P id=id01377>You had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you 
were going to tell.</P>
<P id=id01378>True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you 
half. Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God has 
framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, and in the 
composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they have the greatest 
honour; others he has made of silver, to be auxillaries; others again who are to 
be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron; and the species 
will generally be preserved in the children. But as all are of the same original 
stock, a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a 
golden son. And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all 
else, that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard, or of which they 
are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race. They should observe 
what elements mingle in their off spring; for if the son of a golden or silver 
parent has an admixture of brass and iron, then nature orders a transposition of 
ranks, and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he 
has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there 
may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are 
raised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle says that 
when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. Such is the 
tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it?</P>
<P id=id01379>Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of 
accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and their 
sons' sons, and posterity after them.</P>
<P id=id01380>I see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a 
belief will make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough, 
however, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, 
while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of 
their rulers. Let them look round and select a spot whence they can best 
suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory within, and also defend 
themselves against enemies, who like wolves may come down on the fold from 
without; there let them encamp, and when they have encamped, let them sacrifice 
to the proper Gods and prepare their dwellings.</P>
<P id=id01381>Just so, he said.</P>
<P id=id01382>And their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the 
cold of winter and the heat of summer.</P>
<P id=id01383>I suppose that you mean houses, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01384>Yes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of 
shop-keepers.</P>
<P id=id01385>What is the difference? he said.</P>
<P id=id01386>That I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watchdogs, 
who, from want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit, or evil habit or 
other, would turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but 
wolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?</P>
<P id=id01387>Truly monstrous, he said.</P>
<P id=id01388>And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being 
stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and become 
savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?</P>
<P id=id01389>Yes, great care should be taken.</P>
<P id=id01390>And would not a really good education furnish the best 
safeguard?</P>
<P id=id01391>But they are well-educated already, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01392>I cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much 
certain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that may be, 
will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations 
to one another, and to those who are under their protection.</P>
<P id=id01393>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01394>And not only their education, but their habitations, and all that 
belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as 
guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. Any man of sense must 
acknowledge that.</P>
<P id=id01395>He must.</P>
<P id=id01396>Then let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are 
to realize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should have any 
property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither should they 
have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter; 
their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors, who 
are men of temperance and courage; they should agree to receive from the 
citizens a fixed rate of pay, enough to meet the expenses of the year and no 
more; and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp. Gold and 
silver we will tell them that they have from God; the diviner metal is within 
them, and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men, 
and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture; for that 
commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but their own is 
undefiled. And they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or 
gold, or be under the same roof with them, or wear them, or drink from them. And 
this will be their salvation, and they will be the saviours of the State. But 
should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own, they will become 
housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of 
allies of the other citizens; hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted 
against, they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than 
of external enemies, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the rest of 
the State, will be at hand. For all which reasons may we not say that thus shall 
our State be ordered, and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us 
for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters? other</P>
<P id=id01397>Yes, said Glaucon.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id01398>BOOK IV</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id01399>ADEIMANTUS - SOCRATES</H4>
<P id=id01400>HERE Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, 
Socrates, said he, if a person were to say that you are making these people 
miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the city in 
fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it; whereas other men 
acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses, and have everything handsome 
about them, offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account, and practising 
hospitality; moreover, as you were saying just now, they have gold and silver, 
and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are 
no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting 
guard?</P>
<P id=id01401>Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid 
in addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if they 
would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on a mistress or 
any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is thought to be happiness; 
and many other accusations of the same nature might be added.</P>
<P id=id01402>But, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the 
charge.</P>
<P id=id01403>You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?</P>
<P id=id01404>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01405>If we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we 
shall find the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our 
guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in founding 
the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class, but the 
greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a State which is ordered 
with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find Justice, 
and in the ill-ordered State injustice: and, having found them, we might then 
decide which of the two is the happier. At present, I take it, we are fashioning 
the happy State, not piecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, 
but as a whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of 
State. Suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one came up to us and 
said, Why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts 
of the body—the eyes ought to be purple, but you have made them black—to him we 
might fairly answer, Sir, you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such 
a degree that they are no longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this 
and the other features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. And so 
I say to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness 
which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can clothe our 
husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their heads, and bid them 
till the ground as much as they like, and no more. Our potters also might be 
allowed to repose on couches, and feast by the fireside, passing round the 
winecup, while their wheel is conveniently at hand, and working at pottery only 
as much as they like; in this way we might make every class happy-and then, as 
you imagine, the whole State would be happy. But do not put this idea into our 
heads; for, if we listen to you, the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman, 
the potter will cease to be a potter, and no one will have the character of any 
distinct class in the State. Now this is not of much consequence where the 
corruption of society, and pretension to be what you are not, is confined to 
cobblers; but when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only 
seemingly and not real guardians, then see how they turn the State upside down; 
and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to 
the State. We mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of 
the State, whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who are 
enjoying a life of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their duty to the 
State. But, if so, we mean different things, and he is speaking of something 
which is not a State. And therefore we must consider whether in appointing our 
guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually, or whether 
this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State as a whole. But 
the latter be the truth, then the guardians and auxillaries, and all others 
equally with them, must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the best 
way. And thus the whole State will grow up in a noble order, and the several 
classes will receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to 
them.</P>
<P id=id01406>I think that you are quite right.</P>
<P id=id01407>I wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs 
to me.</P>
<P id=id01408>What may that be?</P>
<P id=id01409>There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.</P>
<P id=id01410>What are they?</P>
<P id=id01411>Wealth, I said, and poverty.</P>
<P id=id01412>How do they act?</P>
<P id=id01413>The process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, 
think you, any longer take the same pains with his art?</P>
<P id=id01414>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01415>He will grow more and more indolent and careless?</P>
<P id=id01416>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01417>And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?</P>
<P id=id01418>Yes; he greatly deteriorates.</P>
<P id=id01419>But, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide 
himself tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor will he 
teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.</P>
<P id=id01420>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01421>Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen 
and their work are equally liable to degenerate?</P>
<P id=id01422>That is evident.</P>
<P id=id01423>Here, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the 
guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city unobserved.</P>
<P id=id01424>What evils?</P>
<P id=id01425>Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and 
indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of 
discontent.</P>
<P id=id01426>That is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know, 
Socrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an enemy 
who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.</P>
<P id=id01427>There would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going to war 
with one such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of them.</P>
<P id=id01428>How so? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01429>In the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be 
trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.</P>
<P id=id01430>That is true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01431>And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was 
perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do 
gentlemen who were not boxers?</P>
<P id=id01432>Hardly, if they came upon him at once.</P>
<P id=id01433>What, not, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and 
strike at the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several 
times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn 
more than one stout personage?</P>
<P id=id01434>Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.</P>
<P id=id01435>And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the 
science and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities.</P>
<P id=id01436>Likely enough.</P>
<P id=id01437>Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with 
two or three times their own number?</P>
<P id=id01438>I agree with you, for I think you right.</P>
<P id=id01439>And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to 
one of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we 
neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore come and 
help us in war, of and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on hearing these 
words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather than, with the dogs 
on their side, against fat and tender sheep?</P>
<P id=id01440>That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor 
State if the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.</P>
<P id=id01441>But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our 
own!</P>
<P id=id01442>Why so?</P>
<P id=id01443>You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one 
of them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed any 
city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, the 
other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and in either there are 
many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether beside the mark if you 
treated them all as a single State. But if you deal with them as many, and give 
the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others, you will always have a 
great many friends and not many enemies. And your State, while the wise order 
which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest 
of States, I do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in deed and 
truth, though she number not more than a thousand defenders. A single State 
which is her equal you will hardly find, either among Hellenes or barbarians, 
though many that appear to be as great and many times greater.</P>
<P id=id01444>That is most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01445>And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix 
when they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory 
which they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?</P>
<P id=id01446>What limit would you propose?</P>
<P id=id01447>I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with 
unity; that, I think, is the proper limit.</P>
<P id=id01448>Very good, he said.</P>
<P id=id01449>Here then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed 
to our guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but one and 
self-sufficing.</P>
<P id=id01450>And surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we 
impose upon them.</P>
<P id=id01451>And the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter 
still, I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when 
inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the lower 
classes, when naturally superior. The intention was, that, in the case of the 
citizens generally, each individual should be put to the use for which nature 
which nature intended him, one to one work, and then every man would do his own 
business, and be one and not many; and so the whole city would be one and not 
many.</P>
<P id=id01452>Yes, he said; that is not so difficult.</P>
<P id=id01453>The regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are 
not, as might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if 
care be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing,—a thing, however, which 
I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our purpose.</P>
<P id=id01454>What may that be? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01455>Education, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated, 
and grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all these, as 
well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as marriage, the 
possession of women and the procreation of children, which will all follow the 
general principle that friends have all things in common, as the proverb 
says.</P>
<P id=id01456>That will be the best way of settling them.</P>
<P id=id01457>Also, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with 
accumulating force like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good 
constitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good education 
improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other 
animals.</P>
<P id=id01458>Very possibly, he said.</P>
<P id=id01459>Then to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the 
attention of our rulers should be directed,—that music and gymnastic be 
preserved in their original form, and no innovation made. They must do their 
utmost to maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most 
regard</P>
<P id=id01460>The newest song which the singers have,</P>
<P id=id01461>they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a 
new kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the 
meaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole 
State, and ought to be prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I can quite believe 
him;-he says that when modes of music change, of the State always change with 
them.</P>
<P id=id01462>Yes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and 
your own.</P>
<P id=id01463>Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their 
fortress in music?</P>
<P id=id01464>Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals 
in.</P>
<P id=id01465>Yes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it 
appears harmless.</P>
<P id=id01466>Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little 
by little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates into 
manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades contracts 
between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions, in 
utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates, by an overthrow of all rights, 
private as well as public.</P>
<P id=id01467>Is that true? I said.</P>
<P id=id01468>That is my belief, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01469>Then, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first 
in a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths 
themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted and 
virtuous citizens.</P>
<P id=id01470>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01471>And when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help 
of music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in a 
manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them in all 
their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there be any fallen 
places a principle in the State will raise them up again.</P>
<P id=id01472>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01473>Thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules 
which their predecessors have altogether neglected.</P>
<P id=id01474>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id01475>I mean such things as these:—when the young are to be silent 
before their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making 
them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to be worn; 
the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general. You would 
agree with me?</P>
<P id=id01476>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01477>But there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such 
matters,—I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written enactments 
about them likely to be lasting.</P>
<P id=id01478>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id01479>It would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education 
starts a man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract 
like?</P>
<P id=id01480>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id01481>Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, 
and may be the reverse of good?</P>
<P id=id01482>That is not to be denied.</P>
<P id=id01483>And for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate 
further about them.</P>
<P id=id01484>Naturally enough, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01485>Well, and about the business of the agora, dealings and the 
ordinary dealings between man and man, or again about agreements with the 
commencement with artisans; about insult and injury, of the commencement of 
actions, and the appointment of juries, what would you say? there may also arise 
questions about any impositions and extractions of market and harbour dues which 
may be required, and in general about the regulations of markets, police, 
harbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to legislate on any 
of these particulars?</P>
<P id=id01486>I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them 
on good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for 
themselves.</P>
<P id=id01487>Yes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws 
which we have given them.</P>
<P id=id01488>And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever 
making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining 
perfection.</P>
<P id=id01489>You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no 
self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?</P>
<P id=id01490>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id01491>Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always 
doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always fancying 
that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try.</P>
<P id=id01492>Such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this 
sort.</P>
<P id=id01493>Yes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their 
worst enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they give up 
eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor cautery nor spell 
nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.</P>
<P id=id01494>Charming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a 
passion with a man who tells you what is right.</P>
<P id=id01495>These gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good 
graces.</P>
<P id=id01496>Assuredly not.</P>
<P id=id01497>Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the 
men whom I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in 
which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution; 
and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges 
them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their 
humours is held to be a great and good statesman—do not these States resemble 
the persons whom I was describing?</P>
<P id=id01498>Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far 
from praising them.</P>
<P id=id01499>But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these 
ready ministers of political corruption?</P>
<P id=id01500>Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some 
whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are 
really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.</P>
<P id=id01501>What do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. 
When a man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare 
that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?</P>
<P id=id01502>Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.</P>
<P id=id01503>Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as 
a play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they are 
always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in 
contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not knowing that 
they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?</P>
<P id=id01504>Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.</P>
<P id=id01505>I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble 
himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the 
constitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for in the 
former they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no difficulty in 
devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous 
regulations.</P>
<P id=id01506>What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of 
legislation?</P>
<P id=id01507>Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there 
remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all.</P>
<P id=id01508>Which are they? he said.</P>
<P id=id01509>The institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service 
of gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of the 
dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the 
inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of which we are ignorant 
ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any 
interpreter but our ancestral deity. He is the god who sits in the center, on 
the navel of the earth, and he is the interpreter of religion to all 
mankind.</P>
<P id=id01510>You are right, and we will do as you propose.</P>
<P id=id01511>But where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me 
where. Now that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search, and 
get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help, and let us 
see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice, and in what they 
differ from one another, and which of them the man who would be happy should 
have for his portion, whether seen or unseen by gods and men.</P>
<H5 id=id01512>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id01513>Nonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, 
saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?</P>
<P id=id01514>I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as 
good as my word; but you must join.</P>
<P id=id01515>We will, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01516>Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: I mean to 
begin with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.</P>
<P id=id01517>That is most certain.</P>
<P id=id01518>And being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and 
just.</P>
<P id=id01519>That is likewise clear.</P>
<P id=id01520>And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one 
which is not found will be the residue?</P>
<P id=id01521>Very good.</P>
<P id=id01522>If there were four things, and we were searching for one of them, 
wherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the first, 
and there would be no further trouble; or we might know the other three first, 
and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.</P>
<P id=id01523>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01524>And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which 
are also four in number?</P>
<P id=id01525>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01526>First among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into 
view, and in this I detect a certain peculiarity.</P>
<P id=id01527>What is that?</P>
<P id=id01528>The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as 
being good in counsel?</P>
<P id=id01529>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01530>And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by 
ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?</P>
<P id=id01531>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01532>And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?</P>
<P id=id01533>Of course.</P>
<P id=id01534>There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of 
knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?</P>
<P id=id01535>Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill 
in carpentering.</P>
<P id=id01536>Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a 
knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements?</P>
<P id=id01537>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01538>Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I 
said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?</P>
<P id=id01539>Not by reason of any of them, he said.</P>
<P id=id01540>Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that 
would give the city the name of agricultural?</P>
<P id=id01541>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01542>Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently founded 
State among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing in 
the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best deal with 
itself and with other States?</P>
<P id=id01543>There certainly is.</P>
<P id=id01544>And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.</P>
<P id=id01545>It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and found among 
those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.</P>
<P id=id01546>And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of 
this sort of knowledge?</P>
<P id=id01547>The name of good in counsel and truly wise.</P>
<P id=id01548>And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more 
smiths?</P>
<P id=id01549>The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.</P>
<P id=id01550>Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who 
receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?</P>
<P id=id01551>Much the smallest.</P>
<P id=id01552>And so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the 
knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole 
State, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and this, which 
has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been ordained by nature 
to be of all classes the least.</P>
<P id=id01553>Most true.</P>
<P id=id01554>Thus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of 
the four virtues has somehow or other been discovered.</P>
<P id=id01555>And, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he 
replied.</P>
<P id=id01556>Again, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of 
courage; and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of 
courageous to the State.</P>
<P id=id01557>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id01558>Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, 
will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State's 
behalf.</P>
<P id=id01559>No one, he replied, would ever think of any other.</P>
<P id=id01560>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01561>The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but 
their courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making 
the city either the one or the other.</P>
<P id=id01562>The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself 
which preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things 
to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them; and 
this is what you term courage.</P>
<P id=id01563>I should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not 
think that I perfectly understand you.</P>
<P id=id01564>I mean that courage is a kind of salvation.</P>
<P id=id01565>Salvation of what?</P>
<P id=id01566>Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and 
of what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the 
words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure or in pain, or 
under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not lose this 
opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?</P>
<P id=id01567>If you please.</P>
<P id=id01568>You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for 
making the true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this 
they prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white ground 
may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then proceeds; and 
whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour, and no washing either 
with lyes or without them can take away the bloom. But, when the ground has not 
been duly prepared, you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple 
or of any other colour.</P>
<P id=id01569>Yes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous 
appearance.</P>
<P id=id01570>Then now, I said, you will understand what our object was in 
selecting our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were 
contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in 
perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other 
opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training, not to be 
washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure—mightier agent far in washing the 
soul than any soda or lye; or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all 
other solvents. And this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in 
conformity with law about real and false dangers I call and maintain to be 
courage, unless you disagree.</P>
<P id=id01571>But I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude 
mere uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave—this, in 
your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to have 
another name.</P>
<P id=id01572>Most certainly.</P>
<P id=id01573>Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?</P>
<P id=id01574>Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a 
citizen,' you will not be far wrong;—hereafter, if you like, we will carry the 
examination further, but at present we are we w seeking not for courage but 
justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.</P>
<P id=id01575>You are right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01576>Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State-first temperance, 
and then justice which is the end of our search.</P>
<P id=id01577>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01578>Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about 
temperance?</P>
<P id=id01579>I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I 
desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and 
therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance 
first.</P>
<P id=id01580>Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your 
request.</P>
<P id=id01581>Then consider, he said.</P>
<P id=id01582>Yes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the 
virtue of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the 
preceding.</P>
<P id=id01583>How so? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01584>Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain 
pleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of 'a man 
being his own master' and other traces of the same notion may be found in 
language.</P>
<P id=id01585>No doubt, he said.</P>
<P id=id01586>There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of 
himself'; for the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in 
all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.</P>
<P id=id01587>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01588>The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a 
better and also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under 
control, then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of 
praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better principle, 
which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse—in 
this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled.</P>
<P id=id01589>Yes, there is reason in that.</P>
<P id=id01590>And now, I said, look at our newly created State, and there you 
will find one of these two conditions realised; for the State, as you will 
acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words 'temperance' 
and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better part over the worse.</P>
<P id=id01591>Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.</P>
<P id=id01592>Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and 
desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in 
the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.</P>
<P id=id01593>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id01594>Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and 
are under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a few, 
and those the best born and best educated.</P>
<P id=id01595>Very true. These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our 
State; and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires and 
wisdom of the few.</P>
<P id=id01596>That I perceive, he said.</P>
<P id=id01597>Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its 
own pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a 
designation?</P>
<P id=id01598>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01599>It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?</P>
<P id=id01600>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01601>And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be 
agreed as to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?</P>
<P id=id01602>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id01603>And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which 
class will temperance be found—in the rulers or in the subjects?</P>
<P id=id01604>In both, as I should imagine, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01605>Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that 
temperance was a sort of harmony?</P>
<P id=id01606>Why so?</P>
<P id=id01607>Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of 
which resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other 
valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through all the 
notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and 
the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or 
power or numbers or wealth, or anything else. Most truly then may we deem 
temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior, as to the 
right to rule of either, both in states and individuals.</P>
<P id=id01608>I entirely agree with you.</P>
<P id=id01609>And so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to 
have been discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a 
state virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.</P>
<P id=id01610>The inference is obvious.</P>
<P id=id01611>The time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should 
surround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away, and pass 
out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country: 
watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her, and if you see her first, 
let me know.</P>
<P id=id01612>Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower 
who has just eyes enough to, see what you show him—that is about as much as I am 
good for.</P>
<P id=id01613>Offer up a prayer with me and follow.</P>
<P id=id01614>I will, but you must show me the way.</P>
<P id=id01615>Here is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; 
still we must push on.</P>
<P id=id01616>Let us push on.</P>
<P id=id01617>Here I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, 
and I believe that the quarry will not escape.</P>
<P id=id01618>Good news, he said.</P>
<P id=id01619>Truly, I said, we are stupid fellows.</P>
<P id=id01620>Why so?</P>
<P id=id01621>Why, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there 
was justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could be 
more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have in their 
hands—that was the way with us—we looked not at what we were seeking, but at 
what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I suppose, we missed her.</P>
<P id=id01622>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id01623>I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been 
talking of justice, and have failed to recognise her.</P>
<P id=id01624>I grow impatient at the length of your exordium.</P>
<P id=id01625>Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You 
remember the original principle which we were always laying down at the 
foundation of the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing 
to which his nature was best adapted;—now justice is this principle or a part of 
it.</P>
<P id=id01626>Yes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.</P>
<P id=id01627>Further, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, 
and not being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have said 
the same to us.</P>
<P id=id01628>Yes, we said so.</P>
<P id=id01629>Then to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to 
be justice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?</P>
<P id=id01630>I cannot, but I should like to be told.</P>
<P id=id01631>Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the 
State when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are 
abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence 
of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their preservative; and we 
were saying that if the three were discovered by us, justice would be the fourth 
or remaining one.</P>
<P id=id01632>That follows of necessity.</P>
<P id=id01633>If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its 
presence contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the agreement 
of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which 
the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or wisdom and watchfulness in 
the rulers, or whether this other which I am mentioning, and which is found in 
children and women, slave and freeman, artisan, ruler, subject,—the quality, I 
mean, of every one doing his own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the 
palm—the question is not so easily answered.</P>
<P id=id01634>Certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying 
which.</P>
<P id=id01635>Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work 
appears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance, 
courage.</P>
<P id=id01636>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id01637>And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?</P>
<P id=id01638>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id01639>Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not 
the rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining 
suits at law?</P>
<P id=id01640>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01641>And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may 
neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?</P>
<P id=id01642>Yes; that is their principle.</P>
<P id=id01643>Which is a just principle?</P>
<P id=id01644>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01645>Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having 
and doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him?</P>
<P id=id01646>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01647>Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a 
carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter; 
and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same 
person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you think 
that any great harm would result to the State?</P>
<P id=id01648>Not much.</P>
<P id=id01649>But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a 
trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his 
followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into the class of 
warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians, for which he is 
unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties of the other; or when 
one man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in one, then I think you will 
agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with 
another is the ruin of the State.</P>
<P id=id01650>Most true.</P>
<P id=id01651>Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any 
meddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest 
harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?</P>
<P id=id01652>Precisely.</P>
<P id=id01653>And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be 
termed by you injustice?</P>
<P id=id01654>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01655>This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the 
auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice, and 
will make the city just.</P>
<P id=id01656>I agree with you.</P>
<P id=id01657>We will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, 
this conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the 
State, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not verified, we 
must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old investigation, which we 
began, as you remember, under the impression that, if we could previously 
examine justice on the larger scale, there would be less difficulty in 
discerning her in the individual. That larger example appeared to be the State, 
and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could, knowing well that in 
the good State justice would be found. Let the discovery which we made be now 
applied to the individual—if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there be 
a difference in the individual, we will come back to the State and have another 
trial of the theory. The friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly 
strike a light in which justice will shine forth, and the vision which is then 
revealed we will fix in our souls.</P>
<P id=id01658>That will be in regular course; let us do as you say.</P>
<P id=id01659>I proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are 
called by the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called 
the same?</P>
<P id=id01660>Like, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01661>The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be 
like the just State?</P>
<P id=id01662>He will.</P>
<P id=id01663>And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in 
the State severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate and 
valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these 
same classes?</P>
<P id=id01664>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id01665>And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three 
principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be rightly 
described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same manner?</P>
<P id=id01666>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id01667>Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy 
question—whether the soul has these three principles or not?</P>
<P id=id01668>An easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that 
hard is the good.</P>
<P id=id01669>Very true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we are 
employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question; the true 
method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a solution not below 
the level of the previous enquiry.</P>
<P id=id01670>May we not be satisfied with that? he said;—under the 
circumstances, I am quite content.</P>
<P id=id01671>I too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.</P>
<P id=id01672>Then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.</P>
<P id=id01673>Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the 
same principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the 
individual they pass into the State?—how else can they come there? Take the 
quality of passion or spirit;—it would be ridiculous to imagine that this 
quality, when found in States, is not derived from the individuals who are 
supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians, Scythians, and in general the 
northern nations; and the same may be said of the love of knowledge, which is 
the special characteristic of our part of the world, or of the love of money, 
which may, with equal truth, be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.</P>
<P id=id01674>Exactly so, he said.</P>
<P id=id01675>There is no difficulty in understanding this.</P>
<P id=id01676>None whatever.</P>
<P id=id01677>But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask 
whether these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn 
with one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third part 
desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the whole soul 
comes into play in each sort of action—to determine that is the difficulty.</P>
<P id=id01678>Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.</P>
<P id=id01679>Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or 
different.</P>
<P id=id01680>How can we? he asked.</P>
<P id=id01681>I replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be 
acted upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time, 
in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things 
apparently the same, we know that they are really not the same, but 
different.</P>
<P id=id01682>Good.</P>
<P id=id01683>For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion 
at the same time in the same part?</P>
<P id=id01684>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id01685>Still, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest 
we should hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man who is 
standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person to say 
that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same moment-to such 
a mode of speech we should object, and should rather say that one part of him is 
in motion while another is at rest.</P>
<P id=id01686>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01687>And suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the 
nice distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin 
round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at the same 
time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot), his 
objection would not be admitted by us, because in such cases things are not at 
rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves; we should rather say that 
they have both an axis and a circumference, and that the axis stands still, for 
there is no deviation from the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes 
round. But if, while revolving, the axis inclines either to the right or left, 
forwards or backwards, then in no point of view can they be at rest.</P>
<P id=id01688>That is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01689>Then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to 
believe that the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation to 
the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.</P>
<P id=id01690>Certainly not, according to my way of thinking.</P>
<P id=id01691>Yet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such 
objections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume their 
absurdity, and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if this 
assumption turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow shall be 
withdrawn.</P>
<P id=id01692>Yes, he said, that will be the best way.</P>
<P id=id01693>Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire 
and aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether they 
are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in the fact of 
their opposition)?</P>
<P id=id01694>Yes, he said, they are opposites.</P>
<P id=id01695>Well, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, 
and again willing and wishing,—all these you would refer to the classes already 
mentioned. You would say—would you not?—that the soul of him who desires is 
seeking after the object of his desires; or that he is drawing to himself the 
thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when a person wants anything to be 
given him, his mind, longing for the realisation of his desires, intimates his 
wish to have it by a nod of assent, as if he had been asked a question?</P>
<P id=id01696>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01697>And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the 
absence of desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of 
repulsion and rejection?</P>
<P id=id01698>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01699>Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a 
particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, 
as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?</P>
<P id=id01700>Let us take that class, he said.</P>
<P id=id01701>The object of one is food, and of the other drink?</P>
<P id=id01702>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01703>And here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul 
has of drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for 
example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any particular 
sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the desire is of cold 
drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink; or, if the thirst be 
excessive, then the drink which is desired will be excessive; or, if not great, 
the quantity of drink will also be small: but thirst pure and simple will desire 
drink pure and simple, which is the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is 
of hunger?</P>
<P id=id01704>Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of 
the simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.</P>
<P id=id01705>But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against 
an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but good 
drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object of desire, 
and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after good drink; and the 
same is true of every other desire.</P>
<P id=id01706>Yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.</P>
<P id=id01707>Nevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some have 
a quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and have 
their correlatives simple.</P>
<P id=id01708>I do not know what you mean.</P>
<P id=id01709>Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the 
less?</P>
<P id=id01710>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01711>And the much greater to the much less?</P>
<P id=id01712>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01713>And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater 
that is to be to the less that is to be?</P>
<P id=id01714>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id01715>And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as 
the double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter and 
the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;—is not this true of 
all of them?</P>
<P id=id01716>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01717>And does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object 
of science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the 
object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; I mean, for 
example, that the science of house-building is a kind of knowledge which is 
defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed 
architecture.</P>
<P id=id01718>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01719>Because it has a particular quality which no other has?</P>
<P id=id01720>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01721>And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a 
particular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?</P>
<P id=id01722>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01723>Now, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my 
original meaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one 
term of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one term is 
qualified, the other is also qualified. I do not mean to say that relatives may 
not be disparate, or that the science of health is healthy, or of disease 
necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good 
and evil; but only that, when the term science is no longer used absolutely, but 
has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease, 
it becomes defined, and is hence called not merely science, but the science of 
medicine.</P>
<P id=id01724>I quite understand, and I think as you do.</P>
<P id=id01725>Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative 
terms, having clearly a relation—</P>
<P id=id01726>Yes, thirst is relative to drink.</P>
<P id=id01727>And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of 
drink; but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor 
bad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?</P>
<P id=id01728>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01729>Then the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, 
desires only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?</P>
<P id=id01730>That is plain.</P>
<P id=id01731>And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from 
drink, that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a 
beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing cannot at the same time 
with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same.</P>
<P id=id01732>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id01733>No more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and 
pull the bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the 
other pulls.</P>
<P id=id01734>Exactly so, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01735>And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?</P>
<P id=id01736>Yes, he said, it constantly happens.</P>
<P id=id01737>And in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that 
there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else 
forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids 
him?</P>
<P id=id01738>I should say so.</P>
<P id=id01739>And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that 
which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?</P>
<P id=id01740>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01741>Then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ 
from one another; the one with which man reasons, we may call the rational 
principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and thirsts 
and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed the irrational or 
appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions?</P>
<P id=id01742>Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.</P>
<P id=id01743>Then let us finally determine that there are two principles 
existing in the soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin to 
one of the preceding?</P>
<P id=id01744>I should be inclined to say—akin to desire.</P>
<P id=id01745>Well, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and 
in which I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion, coming up 
one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside, observed some 
dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution. He felt a desire to 
see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them; for a time he struggled and 
covered his eyes, but at length the desire got the better of him; and forcing 
them open, he ran up to the dead bodies, saying, Look, ye wretches, take your 
fill of the fair sight.</P>
<P id=id01746>I have heard the story myself, he said.</P>
<P id=id01747>The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with 
desire, as though they were two distinct things.</P>
<P id=id01748>Yes; that is the meaning, he said.</P>
<P id=id01749>And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a 
man's desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is 
angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is like the 
struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of his reason;—but 
for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason 
that she should not be opposed, is a sort of thing which thing which I believe 
that you never observed occurring in yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any 
one else?</P>
<P id=id01750>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01751>Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the 
nobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as 
hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon 
him—these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to be excited by 
them.</P>
<P id=id01752>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id01753>But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he 
boils and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and 
because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined 
to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be quelled until he either 
slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice of the shepherd, that is, reason, 
bidding his dog bark no more.</P>
<P id=id01754>The illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we 
were saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the 
rulers, who are their shepherds.</P>
<P id=id01755>I perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, 
however, a further point which I wish you to consider.</P>
<P id=id01756>What point?</P>
<P id=id01757>You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be 
a kind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict 
of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.</P>
<P id=id01758>Most assuredly.</P>
<P id=id01759>But a further question arises: Is passion different from reason 
also, or only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three 
principles in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the 
concupiscent; or rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders, 
auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a third 
element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad education is 
the natural auxiliary of reason</P>
<P id=id01760>Yes, he said, there must be a third.</P>
<P id=id01761>Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be 
different from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.</P>
<P id=id01762>But that is easily proved:—We may observe even in young children 
that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some of 
them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late 
enough.</P>
<P id=id01763>Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute 
animals, which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we 
may once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already quoted by 
us,</P>
<P id=id01764>He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,</P>
<P id=id01765>for in this verse Homer has clearly supposed the power which 
reasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger 
which is rebuked by it.</P>
<P id=id01766>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01767>And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly 
agreed that the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the 
individual, and that they are three in number.</P>
<P id=id01768>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id01769>Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same 
way, and in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?</P>
<P id=id01770>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01771>Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State 
constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the 
individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?</P>
<P id=id01772>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id01773>And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the 
same way in which the State is just?</P>
<P id=id01774>That follows, of course.</P>
<P id=id01775>We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in 
each of the three classes doing the work of its own class?</P>
<P id=id01776>We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.</P>
<P id=id01777>We must recollect that the individual in whom the several 
qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own 
work?</P>
<P id=id01778>Yes, he said, we must remember that too.</P>
<P id=id01779>And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the 
care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be 
the subject and ally?</P>
<P id=id01780>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01781>And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and 
gymnastic will bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with 
noble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness 
of passion by harmony and rhythm?</P>
<P id=id01782>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01783>And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned 
truly to know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in 
each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of 
gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong with the 
fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent soul, no 
longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave and rule those who 
are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the whole life of man?</P>
<P id=id01784>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01785>Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole 
soul and the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and 
the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his commands and 
counsels?</P>
<P id=id01786>True.</P>
<P id=id01787>And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure 
and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?</P>
<P id=id01788>Right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01789>And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, 
and which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a 
knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the 
whole?</P>
<P id=id01790>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id01791>And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same 
elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and 
the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought 
to rule, and do not rebel?</P>
<P id=id01792>Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether 
in the State or individual.</P>
<P id=id01793>And surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by 
virtue of what quality a man will be just.</P>
<P id=id01794>That is very certain.</P>
<P id=id01795>And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form 
different, or is she the same which we found her to be in the State?</P>
<P id=id01796>There is no difference in my opinion, he said.</P>
<P id=id01797>Because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few 
commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.</P>
<P id=id01798>What sort of instances do you mean?</P>
<P id=id01799>If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, 
or the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less likely 
than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver? Would any one 
deny this?</P>
<P id=id01800>No one, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01801>Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, 
or treachery either to his friends or to his country?</P>
<P id=id01802>Never.</P>
<P id=id01803>Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or 
agreements?</P>
<P id=id01804>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id01805>No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his 
father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?</P>
<P id=id01806>No one.</P>
<P id=id01807>And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, 
whether in ruling or being ruled?</P>
<P id=id01808>Exactly so.</P>
<P id=id01809>Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and 
such states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?</P>
<P id=id01810>Not I, indeed.</P>
<P id=id01811>Then our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we 
entertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power 
must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been verified?</P>
<P id=id01812>Yes, certainly.</P>
<P id=id01813>And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the 
shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and 
not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of use?</P>
<P id=id01814>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01815>But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being 
concerned however, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the 
true self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the several 
elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do the work 
of others,—he sets in order his own inner life, and is his own master and his 
own law, and at peace with himself; and when he has bound together the three 
principles within him, which may be compared to the higher, lower, and middle 
notes of the scale, and the intermediate intervals—when he has bound all these 
together, and is no longer many, but has become one entirely temperate and 
perfectly adjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in 
a matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some affair of 
politics or private business; always thinking and calling that which preserves 
and co-operates with this harmonious condition, just and good action, and the 
knowledge which presides over it, wisdom, and that which at any time impairs 
this condition, he will call unjust action, and the opinion which presides over 
it ignorance.</P>
<P id=id01816>You have said the exact truth, Socrates.</P>
<P id=id01817>Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the 
just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we 
should not be telling a falsehood?</P>
<P id=id01818>Most certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01819>May we say so, then?</P>
<P id=id01820>Let us say so.</P>
<P id=id01821>And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.</P>
<P id=id01822>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id01823>Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three 
principles—a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the 
soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by a 
rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal,—what 
is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and intemperance and cowardice 
and ignorance, and every form of vice?</P>
<P id=id01824>Exactly so.</P>
<P id=id01825>And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the 
meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will 
also be perfectly clear?</P>
<P id=id01826>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id01827>Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul 
just what disease and health are in the body.</P>
<P id=id01828>How so? he said.</P>
<P id=id01829>Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which 
is unhealthy causes disease.</P>
<P id=id01830>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01831>And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause 
injustice?</P>
<P id=id01832>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id01833>And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order 
and government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation of 
disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural 
order?</P>
<P id=id01834>True.</P>
<P id=id01835>And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural 
order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the 
creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the 
natural order?</P>
<P id=id01836>Exactly so, he said.</P>
<P id=id01837>Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, 
and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?</P>
<P id=id01838>True.</P>
<P id=id01839>And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to 
vice?</P>
<P id=id01840>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id01841>Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and 
injustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just and 
act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods and men, or to be 
unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and unreformed?</P>
<P id=id01842>In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. 
We know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable, 
though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth and 
all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital 
principle is undermined and corrupted, life is still worth having to a man, if 
only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is 
not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; 
assuming them both to be such as we have described?</P>
<P id=id01843>Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, as we 
are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our 
own eyes, let us not faint by the way.</P>
<P id=id01844>Certainly not, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01845>Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, 
those of them, I mean, which are worth looking at.</P>
<P id=id01846>I am following you, he replied: proceed.</P>
<P id=id01847>I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as 
from some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue is one, 
but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four special ones which 
are deserving of note.</P>
<P id=id01848>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id01849>I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the 
soul as there are distinct forms of the State.</P>
<P id=id01850>How many?</P>
<P id=id01851>There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.</P>
<P id=id01852>What are they?</P>
<P id=id01853>The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and 
which may be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as 
rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.</P>
<P id=id01854>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01855>But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for 
whether the government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have 
been trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the 
State will be maintained.</P>
<P id=id01856>That is true, he replied.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id01857>BOOK V</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id01858>SOCRATES - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS</H4>
<P id=id01859>SUCH is the good and true City or State, and the good and man is 
of the same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the evil is 
one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but also the regulation of 
the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.</P>
<P id=id01860>What are they? he said.</P>
<P id=id01861>I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms 
appeared to me to succeed one another, when Pole marchus, who was sitting a 
little way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching 
forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder, and 
drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying 
something in his ear, of which I only caught the words, 'Shall we let him off, 
or what shall we do?'</P>
<P id=id01862>Certainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.</P>
<P id=id01863>Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?</P>
<P id=id01864>You, he said.</P>
<P id=id01865>I repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off?</P>
<P id=id01866>Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out 
of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy 
that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were self-evident 
to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends have all things 
in common.'</P>
<P id=id01867>And was I not right, Adeimantus?</P>
<P id=id01868>Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like 
everything else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds. 
Please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. We have been long 
expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your 
citizens—how they will bring children into the world, and rear them when they 
have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature of this community of women and 
children-for we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such 
matters will have a great and paramount influence on the State for good or for 
evil. And now, since the question is still undetermined, and you are taking in 
hand another State, we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you 
give an account of all this.</P>
<P id=id01869>To that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying 
Agreed.</P>
<H5 id=id01870>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS</H5>
<P id=id01871>And without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all 
to be equally agreed.</P>
<P id=id01872>I said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What 
an argument are you raising about the State! Just as I thought that I had 
finished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep, and was 
reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I then said, you ask 
me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant of what a hornet's nest of 
words you are stirring. Now I foresaw this gathering trouble, and avoided 
it.</P>
<P id=id01873>For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, 
said<BR>Thrasymachus,—to look for gold, or to hear discourse?<BR></P>
<P id=id01874>Yes, but discourse should have a limit.</P>
<P id=id01875>Yes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only 
limit which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never mind 
about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way: What sort 
of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our 
guardians? and how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which 
seems to require the greatest care? Tell us how these things will be.</P>
<P id=id01876>Yes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many 
more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. For the 
practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another point of 
view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for the best, is also 
doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance to approach the subject, lest our 
aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a dream only.</P>
<P id=id01877>Fear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; 
they are not sceptical or hostile.</P>
<P id=id01878>I said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by 
these words.</P>
<P id=id01879>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id01880>Then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the 
encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had I myself 
believed that I knew what I was talking about: to declare the truth about 
matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love 
him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to carry on an argument 
when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer, which is my condition, is a 
dangerous and slippery thing; and the danger is not that I shall be laughed at 
(of which the fear would be childish), but that I shall miss the truth where I 
have most need to be sure of my footing, and drag my friends after me in my 
fall. And I pray Nemesis not to visit upon me the words which I am going to 
utter. For I do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less 
crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of 
laws. And that is a risk which I would rather run among enemies than among 
friends, and therefore you do well to encourage me.</P>
<P id=id01881>Glaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and 
your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the 
and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then and speak.</P>
<P id=id01882>Well, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free 
from guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.</P>
<P id=id01883>Then why should you mind?</P>
<P id=id01884>Well, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say 
what I perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part of the 
men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the women. Of 
them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I am invited by 
you.</P>
<P id=id01885>For men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my 
opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women 
and children is to follow the path on which we originally started, when we said 
that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd.</P>
<P id=id01886>True.</P>
<P id=id01887>Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be 
subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see whether the 
result accords with our design.</P>
<P id=id01888>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id01889>What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are 
dogs divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in 
keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to the males the 
entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females at home, 
under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for 
them?</P>
<P id=id01890>No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is 
that the males are stronger and the females weaker.</P>
<P id=id01891>But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless 
they are bred and fed in the same way?</P>
<P id=id01892>You cannot.</P>
<P id=id01893>Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have 
the same nurture and education?</P>
<P id=id01894>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01895>The education which was assigned to the men was music and 
gymnastic.<BR>Yes.<BR></P>
<P id=id01896>Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of 
war, which they must practise like the men?</P>
<P id=id01897>That is the inference, I suppose.</P>
<P id=id01898>I should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if 
they are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.</P>
<P id=id01899>No doubt of it.</P>
<P id=id01900>Yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of 
women naked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they are 
no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any more than 
the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to 
frequent the gymnasia.</P>
<P id=id01901>Yes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal 
would be thought ridiculous.</P>
<P id=id01902>But then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we 
must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of 
innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music and 
gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon 
horseback!</P>
<P id=id01903>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01904>Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the 
law; at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be 
serious. Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the 
opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that the sight 
of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the Cretans and then 
the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom, the wits of that day might equally 
have ridiculed the innovation.</P>
<P id=id01905>No doubt.</P>
<P id=id01906>But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was 
far better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye 
vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the man was 
perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight 
but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any 
other standard but that of the good.</P>
<P id=id01907>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id01908>First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in 
earnest, let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she 
capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or not at 
all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share? 
That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and will probably lead to 
the fairest conclusion.</P>
<P id=id01909>That will be much the best way.</P>
<P id=id01910>Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against 
ourselves; in this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended.</P>
<P id=id01911>Why not? he said.</P>
<P id=id01912>Then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They 
will say: 'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you 
yourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle that 
everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.' And certainly, if I 
am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. 'And do not the natures of 
men and women differ very much indeed?' And we shall reply: Of course they do. 
Then we shall be asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should 
not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?' 
Certainly they should. 'But if so, have you not fallen into a serious 
inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so entirely 
different, ought to perform the same actions?'— What defence will you make for 
us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?</P>
<P id=id01913>That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I 
shall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.</P>
<P id=id01914>These are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of a 
like kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to take 
in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children.</P>
<P id=id01915>By Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but 
easy.</P>
<P id=id01916>Why yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his 
depth, whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid-ocean, he 
has to swim all the same.</P>
<P id=id01917>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01918>And must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope 
that<BR>Arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?<BR></P>
<P id=id01919>I suppose so, he said.</P>
<P id=id01920>Well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We 
acknowledged—did we not? that different natures ought to have different 
pursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different. And now what are we 
saying?—that different natures ought to have the same pursuits,—this is the 
inconsistency which is charged upon us.</P>
<P id=id01921>Precisely.</P>
<P id=id01922>Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of 
contradiction!</P>
<P id=id01923>Why do you say so?</P>
<P id=id01924>Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against 
his will. When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just 
because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is speaking; 
and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and 
not of fair discussion.</P>
<P id=id01925>Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to 
do with us and our argument?</P>
<P id=id01926>A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting 
unintentionally into a verbal opposition.</P>
<P id=id01927>In what way?</P>
<P id=id01928>Why, we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, 
that different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered 
at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature, or why we 
distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and 
the same to the same natures.</P>
<P id=id01929>Why, no, he said, that was never considered by us.</P>
<P id=id01930>I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the 
question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy 
men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we should 
forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?</P>
<P id=id01931>That would be a jest, he said.</P>
<P id=id01932>Yes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we 
constructed the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every 
difference, but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which 
the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example, that a physician 
and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature.</P>
<P id=id01933>True.</P>
<P id=id01934>Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different 
natures?</P>
<P id=id01935>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01936>And if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their 
fitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art ought to 
be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference consists only in 
women bearing and men begetting children, this does not amount to a proof that a 
woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should receive; 
and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives 
ought to have the same pursuits.</P>
<P id=id01937>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id01938>Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the 
pursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a 
man?</P>
<P id=id01939>That will be quite fair.</P>
<P id=id01940>And perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a 
sufficient answer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection 
there is no difficulty.</P>
<P id=id01941>Yes, perhaps.</P>
<P id=id01942>Suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, 
and then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the 
constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the 
State.</P>
<P id=id01943>By all means.</P>
<P id=id01944>Let us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question:—when 
you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to say 
that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty; a little 
learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas the other, after 
much study and application, no sooner learns than he forgets; or again, did you 
mean, that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind, while the 
body of the other is a hindrance to him?-would not these be the sort of 
differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is 
ungifted?</P>
<P id=id01945>No one will deny that.</P>
<P id=id01946>And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex 
has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female? Need I 
waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes and 
preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in which for 
her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd?</P>
<P id=id01947>You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general 
inferiority of the female sex: although many women are in many things superior 
to many men, yet on the whole what you say is true.</P>
<P id=id01948>And if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of 
administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or which a 
man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in 
both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also, but in all of them 
a woman is inferior to a man.</P>
<P id=id01949>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01950>Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them 
on women?</P>
<P id=id01951>That will never do.</P>
<P id=id01952>One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, 
and another has no music in her nature?</P>
<P id=id01953>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01954>And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and 
another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?</P>
<P id=id01955>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01956>And one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of 
philosophy; one has spirit, and another is without spirit?</P>
<P id=id01957>That is also true.</P>
<P id=id01958>Then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another 
not. Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of 
this sort?</P>
<P id=id01959>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01960>Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; 
they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.</P>
<P id=id01961>Obviously.</P>
<P id=id01962>And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the 
companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they 
resemble in capacity and in character?</P>
<P id=id01963>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01964>And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?</P>
<P id=id01965>They ought.</P>
<P id=id01966>Then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in 
assigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians—to that point we 
come round again.</P>
<P id=id01967>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id01968>The law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and 
therefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice, 
which prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.</P>
<P id=id01969>That appears to be true.</P>
<P id=id01970>We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, 
and secondly whether they were the most beneficial?</P>
<P id=id01971>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01972>And the possibility has been acknowledged?</P>
<P id=id01973>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01974>The very great benefit has next to be established?</P>
<P id=id01975>Quite so.</P>
<P id=id01976>You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good 
guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the 
same?</P>
<P id=id01977>Yes.</P>
<P id=id01978>I should like to ask you a question.</P>
<P id=id01979>What is it?</P>
<P id=id01980>Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man 
better than another?</P>
<P id=id01981>The latter.</P>
<P id=id01982>And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the 
guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men, 
or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?</P>
<P id=id01983>What a ridiculous question!</P>
<P id=id01984>You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say 
that our guardians are the best of our citizens?</P>
<P id=id01985>By far the best.</P>
<P id=id01986>And will not their wives be the best women?</P>
<P id=id01987>Yes, by far the best.</P>
<P id=id01988>And can there be anything better for the interests of the State 
than that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?</P>
<P id=id01989>There can be nothing better.</P>
<P id=id01990>And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in 
such manner as we have described, will accomplish?</P>
<P id=id01991>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id01992>Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the 
highest degree beneficial to the State?</P>
<P id=id01993>True.</P>
<P id=id01994>Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will 
be their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their 
country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to 
the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects their duties are to 
be the same. And as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their 
bodies from the best of motives, in his laughter he is plucking</P>
<P id=id01995>A fruit of unripe wisdom,</P>
<P id=id01996>and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he 
is about;—for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, That the useful is 
the noble and the hurtful is the base.</P>
<P id=id01997>Very true.</P>
<P id=id01998>Here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may 
say that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for 
enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in 
common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the 
consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.</P>
<P id=id01999>Yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.</P>
<P id=id02000>Yes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will of this when you 
see the next.</P>
<P id=id02001>Go on; let me see.</P>
<P id=id02002>The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has 
preceded, is to the following effect,—'that the wives of our guardians are to be 
common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own 
child, nor any child his parent.'</P>
<P id=id02003>Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the 
possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable.</P>
<P id=id02004>I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the 
very great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is 
quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.</P>
<P id=id02005>I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.</P>
<P id=id02006>You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now 
I meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought; I 
should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the 
possibility.</P>
<P id=id02007>But that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please 
to give a defence of both.</P>
<P id=id02008>Well, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: 
let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting 
themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have discovered any 
means of effecting their wishes—that is a matter which never troubles them—they 
would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities; but assuming 
that what they desire is already granted to them, they proceed with their plan, 
and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true—that 
is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never 
good for much. Now I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with 
your permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present. Assuming 
therefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed to enquire how 
the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I shall demonstrate that our 
plan, if executed, will be of the greatest benefit to the State and to the 
guardians. First of all, then, if you have no objection, I will endeavour with 
your help to consider the advantages of the measure; and hereafter the question 
of possibility.</P>
<P id=id02009>I have no objection; proceed.</P>
<P id=id02010>First, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be 
worthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the one 
and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves obey the 
laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are 
entrusted to their care.</P>
<P id=id02011>That is right, he said.</P>
<P id=id02012>You, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, 
will now select the women and give them to them;—they must be as far as possible 
of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses and meet at 
common meals, None of them will have anything specially his or her own; they 
will be together, and will be brought up together, and will associate at 
gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures 
to have intercourse with each other—necessity is not too strong a word, I 
think?</P>
<P id=id02013>Yes, he said;—necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of 
necessity which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining 
to the mass of mankind.</P>
<P id=id02014>True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed 
after an orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an unholy 
thing which the rulers will forbid.</P>
<P id=id02015>Yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.</P>
<P id=id02016>Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in 
the highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?</P>
<P id=id02017>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id02018>And how can marriages be made most beneficial?—that is a question 
which I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the 
nobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever 
attended to their pairing and breeding?</P>
<P id=id02019>In what particulars?</P>
<P id=id02020>Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are 
not some better than others?</P>
<P id=id02021>True.</P>
<P id=id02022>And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care 
to breed from the best only?</P>
<P id=id02023>From the best.</P>
<P id=id02024>And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe 
age?</P>
<P id=id02025>I choose only those of ripe age.</P>
<P id=id02026>And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds 
would greatly deteriorate?</P>
<P id=id02027>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02028>And the same of horses and animals in general?</P>
<P id=id02029>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id02030>Good heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will 
our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!</P>
<P id=id02031>Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any 
particular skill?</P>
<P id=id02032>Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the 
body corporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require 
medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort of 
practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has to be given, 
then the doctor should be more of a man.</P>
<P id=id02033>That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?</P>
<P id=id02034>I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose 
of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were saying 
that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of 
advantage.</P>
<P id=id02035>And we were very right.</P>
<P id=id02036>And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the 
regulations of marriages and births.</P>
<P id=id02037>How so?</P>
<P id=id02038>Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the 
best of either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior 
with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the 
offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock is to be 
maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on must be a secret which 
the rulers only know, or there will be a further danger of our herd, as the 
guardians may be termed, breaking out into rebellion.</P>
<P id=id02039>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02040>Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring 
together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and suitable 
hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is a matter which 
must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim will be to preserve the 
average of population? There are many other things which they will have to 
consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in 
order as far as this is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too 
large or too small.</P>
<P id=id02041>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02042>We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less 
worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then they 
will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.</P>
<P id=id02043>To be sure, he said.</P>
<P id=id02044>And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other 
honours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with women 
given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought to have as 
many sons as possible.</P>
<P id=id02045>True.</P>
<P id=id02046>And the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for 
offices are to be held by women as well as by men—</P>
<P id=id02047>Yes—</P>
<P id=id02048>The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to 
the pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell 
in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the better when 
they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some mysterious, unknown place, 
as they should be.</P>
<P id=id02049>Yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is 
to be kept pure.</P>
<P id=id02050>They will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to 
the fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that no 
mother recognizes her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged if more are 
required. Care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be 
protracted too long; and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other 
trouble, but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and 
attendants.</P>
<P id=id02051>You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of 
it when they are having children.</P>
<P id=id02052>Why, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our 
scheme. We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?</P>
<P id=id02053>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02054>And what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period 
of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?</P>
<P id=id02055>Which years do you mean to include?</P>
<P id=id02056>A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children 
to the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at 
five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats 
quickest, and continue to beget children until he be fifty-five.</P>
<P id=id02057>Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the 
prime of physical as well as of intellectual vigour.</P>
<P id=id02058>Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the 
public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing; the 
child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have been 
conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers, which at each 
hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer, that the new 
generation may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents, 
whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust.</P>
<P id=id02059>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02060>And the same law will apply to any one of those within the 
prescribed age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life 
without the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a 
bastard to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.</P>
<P id=id02061>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02062>This applies, however, only to those who are within the specified 
age: after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not marry 
his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his mother's mother; 
and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from marrying their sons or 
fathers, or son's son or father's father, and so on in either direction. And we 
grant all this, accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any 
embryo which may come into being from seeing the light; and if any force a way 
to the birth, the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union 
cannot be maintained, and arrange accordingly.</P>
<P id=id02063>That also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how will they 
know who are fathers and daughters, and so on?</P>
<P id=id02064>They will never know. The way will be this:—dating from the day of 
the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male 
children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons, and 
the female children his daughters, and they will call him father, and he will 
call their children his grandchildren, and they will call the elder generation 
grandfathers and grandmothers. All who were begotten at the time when their 
fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters, and 
these, as I was saying, will be forbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is not 
to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and 
sisters; if the lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the Pythian 
oracle, the law will allow them.</P>
<P id=id02065>Quite right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02066>Such is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of 
our State are to have their wives and families in common. And now you would have 
the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity, 
and also that nothing can be better—would you not?</P>
<P id=id02067>Yes, certainly.</P>
<P id=id02068>Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what 
ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the 
organization of a State,—what is the greatest I good, and what is the greatest 
evil, and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the 
good or of the evil?</P>
<P id=id02069>By all means.</P>
<P id=id02070>Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and 
plurality where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of 
unity?</P>
<P id=id02071>There cannot.</P>
<P id=id02072>And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and 
pains—where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy 
and sorrow?</P>
<P id=id02073>No doubt.</P>
<P id=id02074>Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State 
is disorganized—when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other 
plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens?</P>
<P id=id02075>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02076>Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the 
use of the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'</P>
<P id=id02077>Exactly so.</P>
<P id=id02078>And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest 
number of persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the 
same thing?</P>
<P id=id02079>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id02080>Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the 
individual—as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the whole 
frame, drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom under the 
ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part 
affected, and we say that the man has a pain in his finger; and the same 
expression is used about any other part of the body, which has a sensation of 
pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering.</P>
<P id=id02081>Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the 
best-ordered State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which 
you describe.</P>
<P id=id02082>Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, 
the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow 
with him?</P>
<P id=id02083>Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered 
State.</P>
<P id=id02084>It will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see 
whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental 
principles.</P>
<P id=id02085>Very good.</P>
<P id=id02086>Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?</P>
<P id=id02087>True.</P>
<P id=id02088>All of whom will call one another citizens?</P>
<P id=id02089>Of course.</P>
<P id=id02090>But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in 
other States?</P>
<P id=id02091>Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they 
simply call them rulers.</P>
<P id=id02092>And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the 
people give the rulers?</P>
<P id=id02093>They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02094>And what do the rulers call the people?</P>
<P id=id02095>Their maintainers and foster-fathers.</P>
<P id=id02096>And what do they call them in other States?</P>
<P id=id02097>Slaves.</P>
<P id=id02098>And what do the rulers call one another in other States?</P>
<P id=id02099>Fellow-rulers.</P>
<P id=id02100>And what in ours?</P>
<P id=id02101>Fellow-guardians.</P>
<P id=id02102>Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who 
would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being 
his friend?</P>
<P id=id02103>Yes, very often.</P>
<P id=id02104>And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an 
interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?</P>
<P id=id02105>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id02106>But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other 
guardian as a stranger?</P>
<P id=id02107>Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be 
regarded by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or 
daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with 
him.</P>
<P id=id02108>Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a 
family in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name? For 
example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a father be implied 
and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands; 
and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous 
person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of God or of 
man? Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear 
repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them 
to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?</P>
<P id=id02109>These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous 
than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to 
act in the spirit of them?</P>
<P id=id02110>Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more 
often beard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one is well 
or ill, the universal word will be with me 'it is well' or 'it is ill.'</P>
<P id=id02111>Most true.</P>
<P id=id02112>And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not 
saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?</P>
<P id=id02113>Yes, and so they will.</P>
<P id=id02114>And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they 
will alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a 
common feeling of pleasure and pain?</P>
<P id=id02115>Yes, far more so than in other States.</P>
<P id=id02116>And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of 
the State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and 
children?</P>
<P id=id02117>That will be the chief reason.</P>
<P id=id02118>And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as 
was implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of the 
body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?</P>
<P id=id02119>That we acknowledged, and very rightly.</P>
<P id=id02120>Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is 
clearly the source of the greatest good to the State?</P>
<P id=id02121>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02122>And this agrees with the other principle which we were 
affirming,—that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other 
property; their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the 
other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we intended them 
to preserve their true character of guardians.</P>
<P id=id02123>Right, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02124>Both the community of property and the community of families, as I 
am saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the city 
in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man dragging any 
acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own, where he has a 
separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains; but all will be 
affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all 
of one opinion about what is near and dear to them, and therefore they all tend 
towards a common end.</P>
<P id=id02125>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02126>And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call 
their own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will be 
delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are 
the occasion.</P>
<P id=id02127>Of course they will.</P>
<P id=id02128>Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur 
among them. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall 
maintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of the person 
a matter of necessity.</P>
<P id=id02129>That is good, he said.</P>
<P id=id02130>Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man 
has a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and 
not proceed to more dangerous lengths.</P>
<P id=id02131>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02132>To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising 
the younger.</P>
<P id=id02133>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id02134>Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do 
any other violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will he 
slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and fear, mighty to 
prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are 
to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the injured one will be succoured 
by the others who are his brothers, sons, one wi fathers.</P>
<P id=id02135>That is true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02136>Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the 
peace with one another?</P>
<P id=id02137>Yes, there will be no want of peace.</P>
<P id=id02138>And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there 
will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or 
against one another.</P>
<P id=id02139>None whatever.</P>
<P id=id02140>I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they 
will be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the flattery of 
the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men experience in 
bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy necessaries for their 
household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting how they can, and giving the 
money into the hands of women and slaves to keep—the many evils of so many kinds 
which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough, and not 
worth speaking of.</P>
<P id=id02141>Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive 
that.</P>
<P id=id02142>And from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life 
will be blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.</P>
<P id=id02143>How so?</P>
<P id=id02144>The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part 
only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more 
glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost. For 
the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole State; and the 
crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that 
life needs; they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living, 
and after death have an honourable burial.</P>
<P id=id02145>Yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.</P>
<P id=id02146>Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous 
discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians 
unhappy—they had nothing and might have possessed all things-to whom we replied 
that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this question, 
but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians truly guardians, 
and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the greatest happiness, not 
of any particular class, but of the whole?</P>
<P id=id02147>Yes, I remember.</P>
<P id=id02148>And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made 
out to be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors—is the life of 
shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with it?</P>
<P id=id02149>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id02150>At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said 
elsewhere, that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner 
that he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and 
harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but 
infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head 
shall seek to appropriate the whole State to himself, then he will have to learn 
how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more than the whole.'</P>
<P id=id02151>If he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, 
when you have the offer of such a life.</P>
<P id=id02152>You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common 
way of life such as we have described—common education, common children; and 
they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or 
going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt together like 
dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are able, women are to share 
with the men? And in so doing they will do what is best, and will not violate, 
but preserve the natural relation of the sexes.</P>
<P id=id02153>I agree with you, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02154>The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community 
be found possible—as among other animals, so also among men—and if possible, in 
what way possible?</P>
<P id=id02155>You have anticipated the question which I was about to 
suggest.</P>
<P id=id02156>There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried 
on by them.</P>
<P id=id02157>How?</P>
<P id=id02158>Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take 
with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner of 
the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have to do 
when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will have to help and be of 
use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers. Did you never observe in 
the arts how the potters' boys look on and help, long before they touch the 
wheel?</P>
<P id=id02159>Yes, I have.</P>
<P id=id02160>And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and 
in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our 
guardians will be?</P>
<P id=id02161>The idea is ridiculous, he said.</P>
<P id=id02162>There is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other 
animals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to 
valour.</P>
<P id=id02163>That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which 
may often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost as 
well as their parents, and the State will never recover.</P>
<P id=id02164>True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?</P>
<P id=id02165>I am far from saying that.</P>
<P id=id02166>Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on 
some occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?</P>
<P id=id02167>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id02168>Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of 
their youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may 
fairly be incurred.</P>
<P id=id02169>Yes, very important.</P>
<P id=id02170>This then must be our first step,—to make our children spectators 
of war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger; 
then all will be well.</P>
<P id=id02171>True.</P>
<P id=id02172>Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, 
but to know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and what 
dangerous?</P>
<P id=id02173>That may be assumed.</P>
<P id=id02174>And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious 
about the dangerous ones?</P>
<P id=id02175>True.</P>
<P id=id02176>And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans 
who will be their leaders and teachers?</P>
<P id=id02177>Very properly.</P>
<P id=id02178>Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a 
good deal of chance about them?</P>
<P id=id02179>True.</P>
<P id=id02180>Then against such chances the children must be at once furnished 
with wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.</P>
<P id=id02181>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id02182>I mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, 
and when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the horses 
must be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that 
can be had. In this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to 
be their own business; and if there is danger they have only to follow their 
elder leaders and escape.</P>
<P id=id02183>I believe that you are right, he said.</P>
<P id=id02184>Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to 
one another and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose that the 
soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any other 
act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan. 
What do you think?</P>
<P id=id02185>By all means, I should say.</P>
<P id=id02186>And he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made 
a present of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do what they 
like with him.</P>
<P id=id02187>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02188>But the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to 
him?<BR>In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from 
his<BR>youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown 
him.<BR>What do you say?<BR></P>
<P id=id02189>I approve.</P>
<P id=id02190>And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of 
fellowship?</P>
<P id=id02191>To that too, I agree.</P>
<P id=id02192>But you will hardly agree to my next proposal.</P>
<P id=id02193>What is your proposal?</P>
<P id=id02194>That he should kiss and be kissed by them.</P>
<P id=id02195>Most certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: 
Let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the 
expedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether his love be 
youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of valour.</P>
<P id=id02196>Capital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than 
others has been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such 
matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as 
possible?</P>
<P id=id02197>Agreed.</P>
<P id=id02198>Again, there is another manner in which, according to Homer, brave 
youths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax, after he had distinguished 
himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which seems to be a compliment 
appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age, being not only a tribute of 
honour but also a very strengthening thing.</P>
<P id=id02199>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02200>Then in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at 
sacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according to the 
measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those other 
distinctions which we were mentioning; also with</P>
<P id=id02201>seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;</P>
<P id=id02202>and in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training 
them.</P>
<P id=id02203>That, he replied, is excellent.</P>
<P id=id02204>Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not 
say, in the first place, that he is of the golden race?</P>
<P id=id02205>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id02206>Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when 
they are dead</P>
<P id=id02207>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are holy angels upon the earth, 
authors of good,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;averters of evil, the guardians of 
speech-gifted men?<BR></P>
<P id=id02208>Yes; and we accept his authority.</P>
<P id=id02209>We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of 
divine and heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction and we 
must do as he bids?</P>
<P id=id02210>By all means.</P>
<P id=id02211>And in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their 
sepulchres as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who are deemed 
pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any other way, shall be 
admitted to the same honours.</P>
<P id=id02212>That is very right, he said.</P>
<P id=id02213>Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about 
this?</P>
<P id=id02214>In what respect do you mean?</P>
<P id=id02215>First of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that 
Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if 
they can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger 
which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the 
barbarians?</P>
<P id=id02216>To spare them is infinitely better.</P>
<P id=id02217>Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule 
which they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.</P>
<P id=id02218>Certainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the 
barbarians and will keep their hands off one another.</P>
<P id=id02219>Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take 
anything but their armour? Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford 
an excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead, pretending 
that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now has been lost from 
this love of plunder.</P>
<P id=id02220>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02221>And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and 
also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body 
when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind 
him,—is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant, quarrelling 
with the stones which strike him instead?</P>
<P id=id02222>Very like a dog, he said.</P>
<P id=id02223>Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their 
burial?</P>
<P id=id02224>Yes, he replied, we most certainly must.</P>
<P id=id02225>Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least 
of all the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other 
Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken 
from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself?</P>
<P id=id02226>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02227>Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning 
of houses, what is to be the practice?</P>
<P id=id02228>May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?</P>
<P id=id02229>Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual 
produce and no more. Shall I tell you why?</P>
<P id=id02230>Pray do.</P>
<P id=id02231>Why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 
'war,' and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one 
is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is external 
and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and only the second, 
war.</P>
<P id=id02232>That is a very proper distinction, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02233>And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race 
is all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange to 
the barbarians?</P>
<P id=id02234>Very good, he said.</P>
<P id=id02235>And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians 
with Hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight, and 
by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war; but when 
Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas is then in a state of 
disorder and discord, they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be 
called discord.</P>
<P id=id02236>I agree.</P>
<P id=id02237>Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be 
discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands and 
burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear! No true lover 
of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother: 
There might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest, 
but still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean 
to go on fighting for ever.</P>
<P id=id02238>Yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.</P>
<P id=id02239>And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic 
city?</P>
<P id=id02240>It ought to be, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02241>Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?</P>
<P id=id02242>Yes, very civilized.</P>
<P id=id02243>And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as 
their own land, and share in the common temples?</P>
<P id=id02244>Most certainly.</P>
<P id=id02245>And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by 
them as discord only—a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a 
war?</P>
<P id=id02246>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id02247>Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be 
reconciled?<BR>Certainly.<BR></P>
<P id=id02248>They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy 
their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?</P>
<P id=id02249>Just so.</P>
<P id=id02250>And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate 
Hellas, nor will they burn houses, not even suppose that the whole population of 
a city—men, women, and children—are equally their enemies, for they know that 
the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the many are their 
friends. And for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands 
and raze their houses; their enmity to them will only last until the many 
innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction?</P>
<P id=id02251>I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their 
Hellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one 
another.</P>
<P id=id02252>Then let us enact this law also for our guardians:-that they are 
neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.</P>
<P id=id02253>Agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, all our 
previous enactments, are very good.</P>
<P id=id02254>But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on 
in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the 
commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:—Is such an order of things 
possible, and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan 
which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of good to the State. I 
will add, what you have omitted, that your citizens will be the bravest of 
warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for they will all know one another, 
and each will call the other father, brother, son; and if you suppose the women 
to join their armies, whether in the same rank or in the rear, either as a 
terror to the enemy, or as auxiliaries in case of need, I know that they will 
then be absolutely invincible; and there are many domestic tic advantages which 
might also be mentioned and which I also fully acknowledge: but, as I admit all 
these advantages and as many more as you please, if only this State of yours 
were to come into existence, we need say no more about them; assuming then the 
existence of the State, let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways 
and means—the rest may be left.</P>
<P id=id02255>If I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I 
said, and have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves, and 
you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third, which is 
the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and heard the third wave, I think 
you be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was 
natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which I have now to state 
and investigate.</P>
<P id=id02256>The more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more 
determined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible: speak out 
and at once.</P>
<P id=id02257>Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the 
search after justice and injustice.</P>
<P id=id02258>True, he replied; but what of that?</P>
<P id=id02259>I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we 
are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or 
may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him of a higher 
degree of justice than is to be found in other men?</P>
<P id=id02260>The approximation will be enough.</P>
<P id=id02261>We are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the 
character of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly unjust, 
that we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order that we might 
judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they 
exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them, but not with any view of 
showing that they could exist in fact.</P>
<P id=id02262>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id02263>Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated 
with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show 
that any such man could ever have existed?</P>
<P id=id02264>He would be none the worse.</P>
<P id=id02265>Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?</P>
<P id=id02266>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id02267>And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove 
the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?</P>
<P id=id02268>Surely not, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02269>That is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try 
and show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must ask 
you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.</P>
<P id=id02270>What admissions?</P>
<P id=id02271>I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language? 
Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever 
a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth? What 
do you say?</P>
<P id=id02272>I agree.</P>
<P id=id02273>Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will 
in every respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover how a 
city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we have 
discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented. I am sure 
that I should be contented—will not you?</P>
<P id=id02274>Yes, I will.</P>
<P id=id02275>Let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which 
is the cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change 
which will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the change, if 
possible, be of one thing only, or if not, of two; at any rate, let the changes 
be as few and slight as possible.</P>
<P id=id02276>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02277>I think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only 
one change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible 
one.</P>
<P id=id02278>What is it? he said.</P>
<P id=id02279>Now then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest 
of the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and drown 
me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.</P>
<P id=id02280>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id02281>I said: Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of 
this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and 
wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the 
exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest 
from their evils,—nor the human race, as I believe,—and then only will this our 
State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day. Such was the 
thought, my dear Glaucon, which I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed 
too extravagant; for to be convinced that in no other State can there be 
happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing.</P>
<P id=id02282>Socrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the 
word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very 
respectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment, 
and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might and main, 
before you know where you are, intending to do heaven knows what; and if you 
don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion, you will be prepared by 
their fine wits,' and no mistake.</P>
<P id=id02283>You got me into the scrape, I said.</P>
<P id=id02284>And I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out 
of it; but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, I may be 
able to fit answers to your questions better than another—that is all. And now, 
having such an auxiliary, you must do your best to show the unbelievers that you 
are right.</P>
<P id=id02285>I ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable 
assistance. And I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we 
must explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in 
the State; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be discovered 
to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the State; 
and others who are not born to be philosophers, and are meant to be followers 
rather than leaders.</P>
<P id=id02286>Then now for a definition, he said.</P>
<P id=id02287>Follow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be 
able to give you a satisfactory explanation.</P>
<P id=id02288>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id02289>I dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, 
that a lover, if lie is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to some 
one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.</P>
<P id=id02290>I really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my 
memory.</P>
<P id=id02291>Another person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of 
pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do 
somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast, and are thought by 
him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not this a way which you have 
with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his charming face; the 
hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while he who is neither snub 
nor hooked has the grace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are 
children of the gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what 
is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is 
not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word, there is 
no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order 
not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.</P>
<P id=id02292>If you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of 
the argument, I assent.</P>
<P id=id02293>And what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing 
the same? They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.</P>
<P id=id02294>Very good.</P>
<P id=id02295>And the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an 
army, they are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured by 
really great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by lesser and 
meaner people, but honour of some kind they must have.</P>
<P id=id02296>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id02297>Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, 
desire the whole class or a part only?</P>
<P id=id02298>The whole.</P>
<P id=id02299>And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a 
part of wisdom only, but of the whole?</P>
<P id=id02300>Yes, of the whole.</P>
<P id=id02301>And he who dislikes learnings, especially in youth, when he has no 
power of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not to be 
a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his food is not 
hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one?</P>
<P id=id02302>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02303>Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is 
curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher? Am 
I not right?</P>
<P id=id02304>Glaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many 
a strange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights have a 
delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical amateurs, too, are 
a folk strangely out of place among philosophers, for they are the last persons 
in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion, if they 
could help, while they run about at the Dionysiac festivals as if they had let 
out their ears to hear every chorus; whether the performance is in town or 
country—that makes no difference—they are there. Now are we to maintain that all 
these and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of quite minor 
arts, are philosophers?</P>
<P id=id02305>Certainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.</P>
<P id=id02306>He said: Who then are the true philosophers?</P>
<P id=id02307>Those, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.</P>
<P id=id02308>That is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you 
mean?</P>
<P id=id02309>To another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; 
but I am sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.</P>
<P id=id02310>What is the proposition?</P>
<P id=id02311>That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?</P>
<P id=id02312>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02313>And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?</P>
<P id=id02314>True again.</P>
<P id=id02315>And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, 
the same remark holds: taken singly, each of them one; but from the various 
combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they are seen 
in all sorts of lights and appear many? Very true.</P>
<P id=id02316>And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving, 
art-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who are alone 
worthy of the name of philosophers.</P>
<P id=id02317>How do you distinguish them? he said.</P>
<P id=id02318>The lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, 
fond of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that 
are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute 
beauty.</P>
<P id=id02319>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02320>Few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.</P>
<P id=id02321>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02322>And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of 
absolute beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is 
unable to follow—of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only? Reflect: 
is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar things, who 
puts the copy in the place of the real object?</P>
<P id=id02323>I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.</P>
<P id=id02324>But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of 
absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which 
participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the idea 
nor the idea in the place of the objects—is he a dreamer, or is he awake?</P>
<P id=id02325>He is wide awake.</P>
<P id=id02326>And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has 
knowledge, and that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion</P>
<P id=id02327>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02328>But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our 
statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him, without 
revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?</P>
<P id=id02329>We must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02330>Come, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we 
begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and 
that we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should like to ask him a question: 
Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? (You must answer for 
him.)</P>
<P id=id02331>I answer that he knows something.</P>
<P id=id02332>Something that is or is not?</P>
<P id=id02333>Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be 
known?</P>
<P id=id02334>And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points 
of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly 
non-existent is utterly unknown?</P>
<P id=id02335>Nothing can be more certain.</P>
<P id=id02336>Good. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be 
and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the 
absolute negation of being?</P>
<P id=id02337>Yes, between them.</P>
<P id=id02338>And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity 
to not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has to be 
discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge, if 
there be such?</P>
<P id=id02339>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02340>Do we admit the existence of opinion?</P>
<P id=id02341>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id02342>As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?</P>
<P id=id02343>Another faculty.</P>
<P id=id02344>Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of 
matter corresponding to this difference of faculties?</P>
<P id=id02345>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02346>And knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I 
proceed further I will make a division.</P>
<P id=id02347>What division?</P>
<P id=id02348>I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they 
are powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight and 
hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly explained the 
class which I mean?</P>
<P id=id02349>Yes, I quite understand.</P>
<P id=id02350>Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and 
therefore the distinctions of fire, colour, and the like, which enable me to 
discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking of a 
faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and that which has the same 
sphere and the same result I call the same faculty, but that which has another 
sphere and another result I call different. Would that be your way of 
speaking?</P>
<P id=id02351>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02352>And will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would 
you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?</P>
<P id=id02353>Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all 
faculties.</P>
<P id=id02354>And is opinion also a faculty?</P>
<P id=id02355>Certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to 
form an opinion.</P>
<P id=id02356>And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge 
is not the same as opinion?</P>
<P id=id02357>Why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that 
which is infallible with that which errs?</P>
<P id=id02358>An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious 
of a distinction between them.</P>
<P id=id02359>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02360>Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also 
distinct spheres or subject-matters?</P>
<P id=id02361>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id02362>Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge 
is to know the nature of being?</P>
<P id=id02363>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02364>And opinion is to have an opinion?</P>
<P id=id02365>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02366>And do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion 
the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02367>Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in 
faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter, and if, as we were 
saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the sphere of 
knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.</P>
<P id=id02368>Then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else 
must be the subject-matter of opinion?</P>
<P id=id02369>Yes, something else.</P>
<P id=id02370>Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, 
how can there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man has an 
opinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he have an opinion which is 
an opinion about nothing?</P>
<P id=id02371>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id02372>He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?</P>
<P id=id02373>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02374>And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, 
nothing?</P>
<P id=id02375>True.</P>
<P id=id02376>Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary 
correlative; of being, knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02377>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id02378>Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with 
not-being?</P>
<P id=id02379>Not with either.</P>
<P id=id02380>And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02381>That seems to be true.</P>
<P id=id02382>But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in 
a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?</P>
<P id=id02383>In neither.</P>
<P id=id02384>Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than 
knowledge, but lighter than ignorance?</P>
<P id=id02385>Both; and in no small degree.</P>
<P id=id02386>And also to be within and between them?</P>
<P id=id02387>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02388>Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?</P>
<P id=id02389>No question.</P>
<P id=id02390>But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of 
a sort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear 
also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being; and that 
the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be found 
in the interval between them?</P>
<P id=id02391>True.</P>
<P id=id02392>And in that interval there has now been discovered something which 
we call opinion?</P>
<P id=id02393>There has.</P>
<P id=id02394>Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes 
equally of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed 
either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may truly call 
the subject of opinion, and assign each to its proper faculty, the extremes to 
the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean.</P>
<P id=id02395>True.</P>
<P id=id02396>This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion 
that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion the 
beautiful is the manifold—he, I say, your lover of beautiful sights, who cannot 
bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the just is one, or that anything 
is one—to him I would appeal, saying, Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell 
us whether, of all these beautiful things, there is one which will not be found 
ugly; or of the just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will 
not also be unholy?</P>
<P id=id02397>No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found 
ugly; and the same is true of the rest.</P>
<P id=id02398>And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?—doubles, 
that is, of one thing, and halves of another?</P>
<P id=id02399>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id02400>And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, 
will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?</P>
<P id=id02401>True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all 
of them.</P>
<P id=id02402>And can any one of those many things which are called by 
particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this?</P>
<P id=id02403>He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at 
feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he 
hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting. The 
individual objects of which I am speaking are also a riddle, and have a double 
sense: nor can you fix them in your mind, either as being or not-being, or both, 
or neither.</P>
<P id=id02404>Then what will you do with them? I said. Can they have a better 
place than between being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater 
darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence than 
being.</P>
<P id=id02405>That is quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02406>Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the 
multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing 
about in some region which is halfway between pure being and pure not-being?</P>
<P id=id02407>We have.</P>
<P id=id02408>Yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we 
might find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of 
knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the 
intermediate faculty.</P>
<P id=id02409>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id02410>Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see 
absolute beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see 
the many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,—such persons may be said 
to have opinion but not knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02411>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id02412>But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be 
said to know, and not to have opinion only?</P>
<P id=id02413>Neither can that be denied.</P>
<P id=id02414>The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other 
those of opinion? The latter are the same, as I dare say will remember, who 
listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not tolerate the 
existence of absolute beauty.</P>
<P id=id02415>Yes, I remember.</P>
<P id=id02416>Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers 
of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with us for 
thus describing them?</P>
<P id=id02417>I shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what 
is true.</P>
<P id=id02418>But those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers 
of wisdom and not lovers of opinion.</P>
<P id=id02419>Assuredly.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id02420>BOOK VI</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id02421>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H4>
<P id=id02422>AND thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the 
true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.</P>
<P id=id02423>I do not think, he said, that the way could have been 
shortened.</P>
<P id=id02424>I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a 
better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this 
one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us, which he who 
desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the 
unjust must consider.</P>
<P id=id02425>And what is the next question? he asked.</P>
<P id=id02426>Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as 
philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who 
wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask 
you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our State?</P>
<P id=id02427>And how can we rightly answer that question?</P>
<P id=id02428>Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and 
institutions of our State—let them be our guardians.</P>
<P id=id02429>Very good.</P>
<P id=id02430>Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who 
is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?</P>
<P id=id02431>There can be no question of that.</P>
<P id=id02432>And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the 
knowledge of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear 
pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute truth 
and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the other world to 
order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if not already ordered, 
and to guard and preserve the order of them—are not such persons, I ask, simply 
blind?</P>
<P id=id02433>Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.</P>
<P id=id02434>And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides 
being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of 
virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?</P>
<P id=id02435>There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this 
greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place unless 
they fail in some other respect.</P>
<P id=id02436>Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite 
this and the other excellences.</P>
<P id=id02437>By all means.</P>
<P id=id02438>In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the 
philosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about him, 
and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also acknowledge 
that such an union of qualities is possible, and that those in whom they are 
united, and those only, should be rulers in the State.</P>
<P id=id02439>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id02440>Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a 
sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and 
corruption.</P>
<P id=id02441>Agreed.</P>
<P id=id02442>And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true 
being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable, 
which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover and the man 
of ambition.</P>
<P id=id02443>True.</P>
<P id=id02444>And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not 
another quality which they should also possess?</P>
<P id=id02445>What quality?</P>
<P id=id02446>Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their 
mind falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.</P>
<P id=id02447>Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.</P>
<P id=id02448>'May be,' my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather 'must 
be affirmed:' for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all 
that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.</P>
<P id=id02449>Right, he said.</P>
<P id=id02450>And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?</P>
<P id=id02451>How can there be?</P>
<P id=id02452>Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of 
falsehood?</P>
<P id=id02453>Never.</P>
<P id=id02454>The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as 
far as in him lies, desire all truth?</P>
<P id=id02455>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id02456>But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are 
strong in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a 
stream which has been drawn off into another channel.</P>
<P id=id02457>True.</P>
<P id=id02458>He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be 
absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasure—I 
mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.</P>
<P id=id02459>That is most certain.</P>
<P id=id02460>Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; 
for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no 
place in his character.</P>
<P id=id02461>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02462>Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be 
considered.</P>
<P id=id02463>What is that?</P>
<P id=id02464>There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can more 
antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of 
things both divine and human.</P>
<P id=id02465>Most true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02466>Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator 
of all time and all existence, think much of human life?</P>
<P id=id02467>He cannot.</P>
<P id=id02468>Or can such an one account death fearful?</P>
<P id=id02469>No indeed.</P>
<P id=id02470>Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true 
philosophy?</P>
<P id=id02471>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id02472>Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not 
covetous or mean, or a boaster, or a coward-can he, I say, ever be unjust or 
hard in his dealings?</P>
<P id=id02473>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id02474>Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or 
rude and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the 
philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.</P>
<P id=id02475>True.</P>
<P id=id02476>There is another point which should be remarked.</P>
<P id=id02477>What point?</P>
<P id=id02478>Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will 
love that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little 
progress.</P>
<P id=id02479>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id02480>And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he 
learns, will he not be an empty vessel?</P>
<P id=id02481>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id02482>Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless 
occupation? Yes.</P>
<P id=id02483>Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine 
philosophic natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good 
memory?</P>
<P id=id02484>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02485>And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend 
to disproportion?</P>
<P id=id02486>Undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id02487>And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to 
disproportion?</P>
<P id=id02488>To proportion.</P>
<P id=id02489>Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally 
well-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards the 
true being of everything.</P>
<P id=id02490>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02491>Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been 
enumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, 
which is to have a full and perfect participation of being?</P>
<P id=id02492>They are absolutely necessary, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02493>And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue 
who has the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,—noble, gracious, the 
friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?</P>
<P id=id02494>The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with 
such a study.</P>
<P id=id02495>And to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and 
education, and to these only you will entrust the State.</P>
<H5 id=id02496>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS</H5>
<P id=id02497>Here Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, 
Socrates, no one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange 
feeling passes over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led 
astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of skill 
in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and at the end of 
the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their 
former notions appear to be turned upside down. And as unskilful players of 
draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece 
to move, so they too find themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to 
say in this new game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time they 
are in the right. The observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring. 
For any one of us might say, that although in words he is not able to meet you 
at each step of the argument, he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy, 
when they carry on the study, not only in youth as a part of education, but as 
the pursuit of their maturer years, most of them become strange monsters, not to 
say utter rogues, and that those who may be considered the best of them are made 
useless to the world by the very study which you extol.</P>
<P id=id02498>Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?</P>
<P id=id02499>I cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your 
opinion.</P>
<P id=id02500>Hear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.</P>
<P id=id02501>Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease 
from evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged by 
us to be of no use to them?</P>
<P id=id02502>You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in 
a parable.</P>
<P id=id02503>Yes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not 
at all accustomed, I suppose.</P>
<P id=id02504>I perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged 
me into such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then you will 
be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the manner in 
which the best men are treated in their own States is so grievous that no single 
thing on earth is comparable to it; and therefore, if I am to plead their cause, 
I must have recourse to fiction, and put together a figure made up of many 
things, like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures. 
Imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and 
stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar 
infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. The 
sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering—every one is of 
opinion that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of 
navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will further 
assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who 
says the contrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to 
commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others are 
preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having 
first chained up the noble captain's senses with drink or some narcotic drug, 
they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, 
eating and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be 
expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot 
for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own whether by force 
or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and 
abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the 
true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and 
winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really 
qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, 
whether other people like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with 
the steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made 
part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by 
sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be 
called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?</P>
<P id=id02505>Of course, said Adeimantus.</P>
<P id=id02506>Then you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of 
the figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the State; 
for you understand already.</P>
<P id=id02507>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02508>Then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is 
surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain 
it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more 
extraordinary.</P>
<P id=id02509>I will.</P>
<P id=id02510>Say to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be 
useless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to attribute 
their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them, and not to 
themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by 
him—that is not the order of nature; neither are 'the wise to go to the doors of 
the rich'—the ingenious author of this saying told a lie—but the truth is, that, 
when a man is ill, whether he be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and 
he who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern. The ruler who is good 
for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him; although the 
present governors of mankind are of a different stamp; they may be justly 
compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true helmsmen to those who are called 
by them good-for-nothings and star-gazers.</P>
<P id=id02511>Precisely so, he said.</P>
<P id=id02512>For these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the 
noblest pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the 
opposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her 
by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same of whom you 
suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them are arrant rogues, 
and the best are useless; in which opinion I agreed.</P>
<P id=id02513>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02514>And the reason why the good are useless has now been 
explained?</P>
<P id=id02515>True.</P>
<P id=id02516>Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority 
is also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy 
any more than the other?</P>
<P id=id02517>By all means.</P>
<P id=id02518>And let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the 
description of the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember, was his 
leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he was an 
impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.</P>
<P id=id02519>Yes, that was said.</P>
<P id=id02520>Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly 
at variance with present notions of him?</P>
<P id=id02521>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id02522>And have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover 
of knowledge is always striving after being—that is his nature; he will not rest 
in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only, but will go 
on—the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of his desire abate until he 
have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic 
and kindred power in the soul, and by that power drawing near and mingling and 
becoming incorporate with very being, having begotten mind and truth, he will 
have knowledge and will live and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will 
he cease from his travail.</P>
<P id=id02523>Nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of 
him.</P>
<P id=id02524>And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature? 
Will he not utterly hate a lie?</P>
<P id=id02525>He will.</P>
<P id=id02526>And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the 
band which he leads?</P>
<P id=id02527>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id02528>Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance 
will follow after?</P>
<P id=id02529>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02530>Neither is there any reason why I should again set in array the 
philosopher's virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage, 
magnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. And you objected 
that, although no one could deny what I then said, still, if you leave words and 
look at facts, the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly 
useless, and the greater number utterly depraved; we were then led to enquire 
into the grounds of these accusations, and have now arrived at the point of 
asking why are the majority bad, which question of necessity brought us back to 
the examination and definition of the true philosopher.</P>
<P id=id02531>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id02532>And we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic 
nature, why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling—I am speaking of 
those who were said to be useless but not wicked—and, when we have done with 
them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner of men are they 
who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are 
unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies, bring upon philosophy, 
and upon all philosophers, that universal reprobation of which we speak.</P>
<P id=id02533>What are these corruptions? he said.</P>
<P id=id02534>I will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that 
a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a 
philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.</P>
<P id=id02535>Rare indeed.</P>
<P id=id02536>And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare 
natures!</P>
<P id=id02537>What causes?</P>
<P id=id02538>In the first place there are their own virtues, their courage, 
temperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praise worthy qualities 
(and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from 
philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.</P>
<P id=id02539>That is very singular, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02540>Then there are all the ordinary goods of life—beauty, wealth, 
strength, rank, and great connections in the State—you understand the sort of 
things—these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.</P>
<P id=id02541>I understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you 
mean about them.</P>
<P id=id02542>Grasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will 
then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will no 
longer appear strange to you.</P>
<P id=id02543>And how am I to do so? he asked.</P>
<P id=id02544>Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or 
animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil, in 
proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable 
environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than what is not.</P>
<P id=id02545>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02546>There is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under 
alien conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast is 
greater.</P>
<P id=id02547>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02548>And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when 
they are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and the 
spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather 
than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very 
great good or very great evil?</P>
<P id=id02549>There I think that you are right.</P>
<P id=id02550>And our philosopher follows the same analogy-he is like a plant 
which, having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue, 
but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious of all 
weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do you really think, as 
people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by Sophists, or that private 
teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of? Are not the 
public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists? And do they not 
educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after 
their own hearts?</P>
<P id=id02551>When is this accomplished? he said.</P>
<P id=id02552>When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, 
or in a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort, 
and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are being said or 
done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both, shouting and clapping 
their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled 
redoubles the sound of the praise or blame—at such a time will not a young man's 
heart, as they say, leap within him? Will any private training enable him to 
stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be 
carried away by the stream? Will he not have the notions of good and evil which 
the public in general have—he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he 
be?</P>
<P id=id02553>Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.</P>
<P id=id02554>And yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not 
been mentioned.</P>
<P id=id02555>What is that?</P>
<P id=id02556>The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which, as 
you are aware, these new Sophists and educators who are the public, apply when 
their words are powerless.</P>
<P id=id02557>Indeed they do; and in right good earnest.</P>
<P id=id02558>Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, 
can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?</P>
<P id=id02559>None, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02560>No, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of 
folly; there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different 
type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is 
supplied by public opinion—I speak, my friend, of human virtue only; what is 
more than human, as the proverb says, is not included: for I would not have you 
ignorant that, in the present evil state of governments, whatever is saved and 
comes to good is saved by the power of God, as we may truly say.</P>
<P id=id02561>I quite assent, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02562>Then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.</P>
<P id=id02563>What are you going to say?</P>
<P id=id02564>Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call 
Sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing 
but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their assemblies; 
and this is their wisdom. I might compare them to a man who should study the 
tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by him-he would learn 
how to approach and handle him, also at what times and from what causes he is 
dangerous or the reverse, and what is the meaning of his several cries, and by 
what sounds, when another utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may 
suppose further, that when, by continually attending upon him, he has become 
perfect in all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or 
art, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real notion of what he means 
by the principles or passions of which he is speaking, but calls this honourable 
and that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just or unjust, all in accordance 
with the tastes and tempers of the great brute. Good he pronounces to be that in 
which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes; and he can give 
no other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary, 
having never himself seen, and having no power of explaining to others the 
nature of either, or the difference between them, which is immense. By heaven, 
would not such an one be a rare educator?</P>
<P id=id02565>Indeed, he would.</P>
<P id=id02566>And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment 
of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, 
or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing? For when 
a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art 
or the service which he has done the State, making them his judges when he is 
not obliged, the so-called necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce 
whatever they praise. And yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give 
in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good. Did you ever 
hear any of them which were not?</P>
<P id=id02567>No, nor am I likely to hear.</P>
<P id=id02568>You recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then let me 
ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in 
the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the 
absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?</P>
<P id=id02569>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id02570>Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?</P>
<P id=id02571>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id02572>And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure 
of the world?</P>
<P id=id02573>They must.</P>
<P id=id02574>And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please 
them?</P>
<P id=id02575>That is evident.</P>
<P id=id02576>Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved 
in his calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that he was 
to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence—these were admitted by 
us to be the true philosopher's gifts.</P>
<P id=id02577>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02578>Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things 
first among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental 
ones?</P>
<P id=id02579>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id02580>And his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he 
gets older for their own purposes?</P>
<P id=id02581>No question.</P>
<P id=id02582>Falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him 
honour and flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the power 
which he will one day possess.</P>
<P id=id02583>That often happens, he said.</P>
<P id=id02584>And what will a man such as he be likely to do under such 
circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, 
and a tall proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless aspirations, and fancy 
himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and of barbarians, and having got 
such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness 
of vain pomp and senseless pride?</P>
<P id=id02585>To be sure he will.</P>
<P id=id02586>Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to 
him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only 
be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, 
he will be easily induced to listen?</P>
<P id=id02587>Far otherwise.</P>
<P id=id02588>And even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or 
natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken 
captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that they are 
likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his 
companionship? Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to 
his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using to this end private 
intrigues as well as public prosecutions?</P>
<P id=id02589>There can be no doubt of it.</P>
<P id=id02590>And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a 
philosopher?</P>
<P id=id02591>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id02592>Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities 
which make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from 
philosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called 
goods of life?</P>
<P id=id02593>We were quite right.</P>
<P id=id02594>Thus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and 
failure which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of 
all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time; this 
being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest 
evil to States and individuals; and also of the greatest good when the tide 
carries them in that direction; but a small man never was the doer of any great 
thing either to individuals or to States.</P>
<P id=id02595>That is most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02596>And so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite 
incomplete: for her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are 
leading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing that she has 
no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour her; and fasten upon her 
the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers utter, who affirm of her 
votaries that some are good for nothing, and that the greater number deserve the 
severest punishment.</P>
<P id=id02597>That is certainly what people say.</P>
<P id=id02598>Yes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the 
puny creatures who, seeing this land open to them—a land well stocked with fair 
names and showy titles—like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary, 
take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those who do so being probably 
the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts? For, although philosophy be 
in this evil case, still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be 
found in the arts. And many are thus attracted by her whose natures are 
imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as 
their bodies are by their trades and crafts. Is not this unavoidable?</P>
<P id=id02599>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02600>Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got 
out of durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new coat, 
and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's daughter, who is 
left poor and desolate?</P>
<P id=id02601>A most exact parallel.</P>
<P id=id02602>What will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile 
and bastard?</P>
<P id=id02603>There can be no question of it.</P>
<P id=id02604>And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy 
and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas and 
opinions are likely to be generated? Will they not be sophisms captivating to 
the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true 
wisdom?</P>
<P id=id02605>No doubt, he said.</P>
<P id=id02606>Then, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will 
be but a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person, detained 
by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting influences remains 
devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city, the politics of which he 
contemns and neglects; and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts, which 
they justly despise, and come to her;—or peradventure there are some who are 
restrained by our friend Theages' bridle; for everything in the life of Theages 
conspired to divert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from 
politics. My own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for 
rarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other man. Those who 
belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession 
philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude; and 
they know that no politician is honest, nor is there any champion of justice at 
whose side they may fight and be saved. Such an one may be compared to a man who 
has fallen among wild beasts—he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, 
but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore 
seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and reflecting 
that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to 
himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, 
in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires 
under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, 
he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or 
unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.</P>
<P id=id02607>Yes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he 
departs.</P>
<P id=id02608>A great work—yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State 
suitable to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a larger 
growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.</P>
<P id=id02609>The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been 
sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has been 
shown-is there anything more which you wish to say?</P>
<P id=id02610>Nothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to 
know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to 
her.</P>
<P id=id02611>Not any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation 
which I bring against them—not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature, 
and hence that nature is warped and estranged;—as the exotic seed which is sown 
in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be overpowered and to 
lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth of philosophy, instead of 
persisting, degenerates and receives another character. But if philosophy ever 
finds in the State that perfection which she herself is, then will be seen that 
she is in truth divine, and that all other things, whether natures of men or 
institutions, are but human;—and now, I know that you are going to ask, what 
that State is.</P>
<P id=id02612>No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another 
question—whether it is the State of which we are the founders and inventors, or 
some other?</P>
<P id=id02613>Yes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my 
saying before, that some living authority would always be required in the State 
having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you 
were laying down the laws.</P>
<P id=id02614>That was said, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02615>Yes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by 
interposing objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long 
and difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.</P>
<P id=id02616>What is there remaining?</P>
<P id=id02617>The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not 
to be the ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard is 
the good,' as men say.</P>
<P id=id02618>Still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will 
then be complete.</P>
<P id=id02619>I shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at 
all, by a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to 
remark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I declare that 
States should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but in a different 
spirit.</P>
<P id=id02620>In what manner?</P>
<P id=id02621>At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young; 
beginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time saved 
from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those of them who 
are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when they come within sight 
of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean dialectic, take themselves off. 
In after life when invited by some one else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a 
lecture, and about this they make much ado, for philosophy is not considered by 
them to be their proper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases 
they are extinguished more truly than Heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as they never 
light up again.</P>
<P id=id02622>But what ought to be their course?</P>
<P id=id02623>Just the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what 
philosophy they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this 
period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and special care 
should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of 
philosophy; as life advances and the intellect begins to mature, let them 
increase the gymnastics of the soul; but when the strength of our citizens fails 
and is past civil and military duties, then let them range at will and engage in 
no serious labour, as we intend them to live happily here, and to crown this 
life with a similar happiness in another.</P>
<P id=id02624>How truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of 
that; and yet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still 
more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced; 
Thrasymachus least of all.</P>
<P id=id02625>Do not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and me, who 
have recently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for I 
shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and other men, or 
do something which may profit them against the day when they live again, and 
hold the like discourse in another state of existence.</P>
<P id=id02626>You are speaking of a time which is not very near.</P>
<P id=id02627>Rather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison 
with eternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe; 
for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised; they have 
seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting of words 
artificially brought together, not like these of ours having a natural unity. 
But a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded, as far as he can 
be, into the proportion and likeness of virtue—such a man ruling in a city which 
bears the same image, they have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them—do 
you think that they ever did?</P>
<P id=id02628>No indeed.</P>
<P id=id02629>No, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble 
sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in 
their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while they look 
coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is opinion and strife, 
whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in society.</P>
<P id=id02630>They are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.</P>
<P id=id02631>And this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth 
forced us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor 
States nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of 
philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially 
compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the State, and until a like 
necessity be laid on the State to obey them; or until kings, or if not kings, 
the sons of kings or princes, are divinely inspired with a true love of true 
philosophy. That either or both of these alternatives are impossible, I see no 
reason to affirm: if they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as 
dreamers and visionaries. Am I not right?</P>
<P id=id02632>Quite right.</P>
<P id=id02633>If then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour 
in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected 
philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power 
to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert to the death, that this 
our constitution has been, and is—yea, and will be whenever the Muse of 
Philosophy is queen. There is no impossibility in all this; that there is a 
difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.</P>
<P id=id02634>My opinion agrees with yours, he said.</P>
<P id=id02635>But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the 
multitude?</P>
<P id=id02636>I should imagine not, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02637>O my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will change 
their minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the view of 
soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show them your 
philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their 
character and profession, and then mankind will see that he of whom you are 
speaking is not such as they supposed—if they view him in this new light, they 
will surely change their notion of him, and answer in another strain. Who can be 
at enmity with one who loves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy 
will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy? Nay, let me answer for you, 
that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of 
mankind.</P>
<P id=id02638>I quite agree with you, he said.</P>
<P id=id02639>And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which 
the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush in 
uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them, who make 
persons instead of things the theme of their conversation? and nothing can be 
more unbecoming in philosophers than this.</P>
<P id=id02640>It is most unbecoming.</P>
<P id=id02641>For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has 
surely no time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with 
malice and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards things 
fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another, 
but all in order moving according to reason; these he imitates, and to these he 
will, as far as he can, conform himself. Can a man help imitating that with 
which he holds reverential converse?</P>
<P id=id02642>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id02643>And the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, 
becomes orderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every 
one else, he will suffer from detraction.</P>
<P id=id02644>Of course.</P>
<P id=id02645>And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only 
himself, but human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that 
which he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful artificer of 
justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?</P>
<P id=id02646>Anything but unskilful.</P>
<P id=id02647>And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is 
the truth, will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us, when we 
tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists who 
imitate the heavenly pattern?</P>
<P id=id02648>They will not be angry if they understand, he said. But how will 
they draw out the plan of which you are speaking?</P>
<P id=id02649>They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from 
which, as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean 
surface. This is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will lie the 
difference between them and every other legislator,—they will have nothing to do 
either with individual or State, and will inscribe no laws, until they have 
either found, or themselves made, a clean surface.</P>
<P id=id02650>They will be very right, he said.</P>
<P id=id02651>Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the 
constitution?</P>
<P id=id02652>No doubt.</P>
<P id=id02653>And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will 
often turn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first look at 
absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human copy; and 
will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man; and 
thus they will conceive according to that other image, which, when existing 
among men, Homer calls the form and likeness of God.</P>
<P id=id02654>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02655>And one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, 
they have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways of 
God?</P>
<P id=id02656>Indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.</P>
<P id=id02657>And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you 
described as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of 
constitutions is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very 
indignant because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a 
little calmer at what they have just heard?</P>
<P id=id02658>Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.</P>
<P id=id02659>Why, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they 
doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?</P>
<P id=id02660>They would not be so unreasonable.</P>
<P id=id02661>Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to 
the highest good?</P>
<P id=id02662>Neither can they doubt this.</P>
<P id=id02663>But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under 
favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was? 
Or will they prefer those whom we have rejected?</P>
<P id=id02664>Surely not.</P>
<P id=id02665>Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until 
philosophers bear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor 
will this our imaginary State ever be realised?</P>
<P id=id02666>I think that they will be less angry.</P>
<P id=id02667>Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite 
gentle, and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other 
reason, cannot refuse to come to terms?</P>
<P id=id02668>By all means, he said.</P>
<P id=id02669>Then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. 
Will any one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes 
who are by nature philosophers?</P>
<P id=id02670>Surely no man, he said.</P>
<P id=id02671>And when they have come into being will any one say that they must 
of necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by 
us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape—who 
will venture to affirm this?</P>
<P id=id02672>Who indeed!</P>
<P id=id02673>But, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city 
obedient to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about 
which the world is so incredulous.</P>
<P id=id02674>Yes, one is enough.</P>
<P id=id02675>The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been 
describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?</P>
<P id=id02676>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02677>And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle 
or impossibility?</P>
<P id=id02678>I think not.</P>
<P id=id02679>But we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all 
this, if only possible, is assuredly for the best.</P>
<P id=id02680>We have.</P>
<P id=id02681>And now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, 
would be for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult, is 
not impossible.</P>
<P id=id02682>Very good.</P>
<P id=id02683>And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, 
but more remains to be discussed;—how and by what studies and pursuits will the 
saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they to apply 
themselves to their several studies?</P>
<P id=id02684>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02685>I omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and 
the procreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because I knew 
that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of 
attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me, for I 
had to discuss them all the same. The women and children are now disposed of, 
but the other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very 
beginning. We were saying, as you will remember, that they were to be lovers of 
their country, tried by the test of pleasures and pains, and neither in 
hardships, nor in dangers, nor at any other critical moment were to lose their 
patriotism—he was to be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure, 
like gold tried in the refiner's fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive 
honours and rewards in life and after death. This was the sort of thing which 
was being said, and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face; not 
liking to stir the question which has now arisen.</P>
<P id=id02686>I perfectly remember, he said.</P>
<P id=id02687>Yes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding the bold 
word; but now let me dare to say—that the perfect guardian must be a 
philosopher.</P>
<P id=id02688>Yes, he said, let that be affirmed.</P>
<P id=id02689>And do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts 
which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly 
found in shreds and patches.</P>
<P id=id02690>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id02691>You are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, 
sagacity, cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and 
that persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and 
magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a 
peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their impulses, and all 
solid principle goes out of them.</P>
<P id=id02692>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02693>On the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be 
depended upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are 
equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always in a 
torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual 
toil.</P>
<P id=id02694>Quite true.</P>
<P id=id02695>And yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those 
to whom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in any 
office or command.</P>
<P id=id02696>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id02697>And will they be a class which is rarely found?</P>
<P id=id02698>Yes, indeed.</P>
<P id=id02699>Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and 
dangers and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of 
probation which we did not mention—he must be exercised also in many kinds of 
knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all, 
will faint under them, as in any other studies and exercises.</P>
<P id=id02700>Yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you 
mean by the highest of all knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02701>You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three 
parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, 
and wisdom?</P>
<P id=id02702>Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear 
more.</P>
<P id=id02703>And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the 
discussion of them?</P>
<P id=id02704>To what do you refer?</P>
<P id=id02705>We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see 
them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the 
end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular exposition of 
them on a level with the discussion which had preceded. And you replied that 
such an exposition would be enough for you, and so the enquiry was continued in 
what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner; whether you were satisfied or 
not, it is for you to say.</P>
<P id=id02706>Yes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a 
fair measure of truth.</P>
<P id=id02707>But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things Which in any 
degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing imperfect 
is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be contented and 
think that they need search no further.</P>
<P id=id02708>Not an uncommon case when people are indolent.</P>
<P id=id02709>Yes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of 
the<BR>State and of the laws.<BR></P>
<P id=id02710>True.</P>
<P id=id02711>The guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer 
circuit, and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach 
the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his proper 
calling.</P>
<P id=id02712>What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this—higher 
than justice and the other virtues?</P>
<P id=id02713>Yes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not 
the outline merely, as at present—nothing short of the most finished picture 
should satisfy us. When little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains, 
in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness, how 
ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the 
highest accuracy!</P>
<P id=id02714>A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain 
from asking you what is this highest knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02715>Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard 
the answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I rather 
think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have of been told that the 
idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other things become useful 
and advantageous only by their use of this. You can hardly be ignorant that of 
this I was about to speak, concerning which, as you have often heard me say, we 
know so little; and, without which, any other knowledge or possession of any 
kind will profit us nothing. Do you think that the possession of all other 
things is of any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all 
other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?</P>
<P id=id02716>Assuredly not.</P>
<P id=id02717>You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the 
good, but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge</P>
<P id=id02718>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02719>And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they 
mean by knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?</P>
<P id=id02720>How ridiculous!</P>
<P id=id02721>Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our 
ignorance of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it—for the good they 
define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them when they use 
the term 'good'—this is of course ridiculous.</P>
<P id=id02722>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02723>And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; 
for they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as 
good.</P>
<P id=id02724>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02725>And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?</P>
<P id=id02726>True.</P>
<P id=id02727>There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which 
this question is involved.</P>
<P id=id02728>There can be none.</P>
<P id=id02729>Further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or 
to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one is 
satisfied with the appearance of good—the reality is what they seek; in the case 
of the good, appearance is despised by every one.</P>
<P id=id02730>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02731>Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of 
all his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet 
hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of 
this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever good there is in other 
things,—of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our 
State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be in the darkness of ignorance?</P>
<P id=id02732>Certainly not, he said.</P>
<P id=id02733>I am sure, I said, that he who does not know now the beautiful and 
the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I suspect 
that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them.</P>
<P id=id02734>That, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.</P>
<P id=id02735>And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State 
will be perfectly ordered?</P>
<P id=id02736>Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether 
you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure, or 
different from either.</P>
<P id=id02737>Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you 
would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these 
matters.</P>
<P id=id02738>True, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a 
lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions 
of others, and never telling his own.</P>
<P id=id02739>Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not 
know?</P>
<P id=id02740>Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no 
right to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.</P>
<P id=id02741>And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and 
the best of them blind? You would not deny that those who have any true notion 
without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the 
road?</P>
<P id=id02742>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02743>And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when 
others will tell you of brightness and beauty?</P>
<H5 id=id02744>GLAUCON - SOCRATES</H5>
<P id=id02745>Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn 
away just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an 
explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and 
the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.</P>
<P id=id02746>Yes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I 
cannot help fearing that I shall fall, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring 
ridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is the actual 
nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort 
too great for me. But of the child of the good who is likest him, I would fain 
speak, if I could be sure that you wished to hear—otherwise, not.</P>
<P id=id02747>By all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall 
remain in our debt for the account of the parent.</P>
<P id=id02748>I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, 
the account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take, 
however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a care that i 
do not render a false account, although I have no intention of deceiving 
you.</P>
<P id=id02749>Yes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.</P>
<P id=id02750>Yes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, 
and remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion, and at 
many other times.</P>
<P id=id02751>What?</P>
<P id=id02752>The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and 
so of other things which we describe and define; to all of them 'many' is 
applied.</P>
<P id=id02753>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id02754>And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other 
things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for they may be 
brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of each.</P>
<P id=id02755>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02756>The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are 
known but not seen.</P>
<P id=id02757>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id02758>And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?</P>
<P id=id02759>The sight, he said.</P>
<P id=id02760>And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses 
perceive the other objects of sense?</P>
<P id=id02761>True.</P>
<P id=id02762>But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and 
complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever 
contrived?</P>
<P id=id02763>No, I never have, he said.</P>
<P id=id02764>Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional 
nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard?</P>
<P id=id02765>Nothing of the sort.</P>
<P id=id02766>No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, 
the other senses—you would not say that any of them requires such an 
addition?</P>
<P id=id02767>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id02768>But you see that without the addition of some other nature there 
is no seeing or being seen?</P>
<P id=id02769>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id02770>Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes 
wanting to see; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third 
nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see nothing 
and the colours will be invisible.</P>
<P id=id02771>Of what nature are you speaking?</P>
<P id=id02772>Of that which you term light, I replied.</P>
<P id=id02773>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id02774>Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and 
visibility, and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for 
light is their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?</P>
<P id=id02775>Nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.</P>
<P id=id02776>And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the 
lord of this element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly 
and the visible to appear?</P>
<P id=id02777>You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.</P>
<P id=id02778>May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as 
follows?</P>
<P id=id02779>How?</P>
<P id=id02780>Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?</P>
<P id=id02781>No.</P>
<P id=id02782>Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the 
sun?</P>
<P id=id02783>By far the most like.</P>
<P id=id02784>And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which 
is dispensed from the sun?</P>
<P id=id02785>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id02786>Then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is 
recognised by sight.</P>
<P id=id02787>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id02788>And this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good 
begat in his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight and 
the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to 
mind and the things of mind.</P>
<P id=id02789>Will you be a little more explicit? he said.</P>
<P id=id02790>Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them 
towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and 
stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no clearness of 
vision in them?</P>
<P id=id02791>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02792>But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun 
shines, they see clearly and there is sight in them?</P>
<P id=id02793>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02794>And the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which 
truth and being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with 
intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing, 
then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is first of one opinion 
and then of another, and seems to have no intelligence?</P>
<P id=id02795>Just so.</P>
<P id=id02796>Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of 
knowing to the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good, and this 
you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as the latter 
becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both truth and 
knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful 
than either; and, as in the previous instance, light and sight may be truly said 
to be like the sun, and yet not to be the sun, so in this other sphere, science 
and truth may be deemed to be like the good, but not the good; the good has a 
place of honour yet higher.</P>
<P id=id02797>What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author 
of science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely cannot 
mean to say that pleasure is the good?</P>
<P id=id02798>God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in 
another point of view?</P>
<P id=id02799>In what point of view?</P>
<P id=id02800>You would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of 
visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth, 
though he himself is not generation?</P>
<P id=id02801>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02802>In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of 
knowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good 
is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.</P>
<P id=id02803>Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of 
heaven, how amazing!</P>
<P id=id02804>Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you 
made me utter my fancies.</P>
<P id=id02805>And pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there 
is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.</P>
<P id=id02806>Yes, I said, there is a great deal more.</P>
<P id=id02807>Then omit nothing, however slight.</P>
<P id=id02808>I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal 
will have to be omitted.</P>
<P id=id02809>You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and 
that one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the visible. 
I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing upon the name 
('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). May I suppose that you have this distinction of the 
visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?</P>
<P id=id02810>I have.</P>
<P id=id02811>Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and 
divide each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main 
divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and 
then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of 
clearness, and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible 
consists of images. And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in 
the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies 
and the like: Do you understand?</P>
<P id=id02812>Yes, I understand.</P>
<P id=id02813>Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the 
resemblance, to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or 
is made.</P>
<P id=id02814>Very good.</P>
<P id=id02815>Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have 
different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere 
of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?</P>
<P id=id02816>Most undoubtedly.</P>
<P id=id02817>Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the 
intellectual is to be divided.</P>
<P id=id02818>In what manner?</P>
<P id=id02819>Thus:—There are two subdivisions, in the lower or which the soul 
uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be 
hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other 
end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to 
a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former 
case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.</P>
<P id=id02820>I do not quite understand your meaning, he said.</P>
<P id=id02821>Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have 
made some preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry, 
arithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures 
and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science; 
these are their hypotheses, which they and everybody are supposed to know, and 
therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or 
others; but they begin with them, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a 
consistent manner, at their conclusion?</P>
<P id=id02822>Yes, he said, I know.</P>
<P id=id02823>And do you not know also that although they make use of the 
visible forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the 
ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of the 
absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on—the forms which they draw 
or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own, are 
converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to behold the things 
themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind?</P>
<P id=id02824>That is true.</P>
<P id=id02825>And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the 
search after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a 
first principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis, 
but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their 
turn as images, they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a 
greater distinctness, and therefore a higher value.</P>
<P id=id02826>I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of 
geometry and the sister arts.</P>
<P id=id02827>And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you 
will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself 
attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, 
but only as hypotheses—that is to say, as steps and points of departure into a 
world which is above hypotheses, in order that she may soar beyond them to the 
first principle of the whole; and clinging to this and then to that which 
depends on this, by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any 
sensible object, from ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.</P>
<P id=id02828>I understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to 
be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I understand 
you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of dialectic 
contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as they are termed, 
which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also contemplated by the 
understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because they start from hypotheses 
and do not ascend to a principle, those who contemplate them appear to you not 
to exercise the higher reason upon them, although when a first principle is 
added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason. And the habit which is 
concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term 
understanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and 
reason.</P>
<P id=id02829>You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, 
corresponding to these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the 
soul-reason answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or 
conviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last-and let there be 
a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in 
the same degree that their objects have truth.</P>
<P id=id02830>I understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your 
arrangement.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id02831>BOOK VII</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id02832>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H4>
<P id=id02833>AND now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is 
enlightened or unenlightened:—Behold! human beings living in a underground den, 
which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here 
they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so 
that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the 
chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing 
at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and 
you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which 
marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.</P>
<P id=id02834>I see.</P>
<P id=id02835>And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all 
sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and 
various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others 
silent.</P>
<P id=id02836>You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange 
prisoners.</P>
<P id=id02837>Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or 
the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the 
cave?</P>
<P id=id02838>True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they 
were never allowed to move their heads?</P>
<P id=id02839>And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they 
would only see the shadows?</P>
<P id=id02840>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id02841>And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not 
suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?</P>
<P id=id02842>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02843>And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from 
the other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke 
that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?</P>
<P id=id02844>No question, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02845>To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the 
shadows of the images.</P>
<P id=id02846>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id02847>And now look again, and see what will naturally follow it' the 
prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them 
is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk 
and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress 
him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he 
had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw 
before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and 
his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, what 
will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing 
to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,—will he not be 
perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer 
than the objects which are now shown to him?</P>
<P id=id02848>Far truer.</P>
<P id=id02849>And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not 
have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the 
objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality 
clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?</P>
<P id=id02850>True, he now</P>
<P id=id02851>And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep 
and rugged ascent, and held fast until he's forced into the presence of the sun 
himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he approaches the 
light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all 
of what are now called realities.</P>
<P id=id02852>Not all in a moment, he said.</P>
<P id=id02853>He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper 
world. And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and 
other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will gaze 
upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; and he will 
see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun 
by day?</P>
<P id=id02854>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02855>Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections 
of him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in 
another; and he will contemplate him as he is.</P>
<P id=id02856>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02857>He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season 
and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a 
certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been 
accustomed to behold?</P>
<P id=id02858>Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about 
him.</P>
<P id=id02859>And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the 
den and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate 
himself on the change, and pity them?</P>
<P id=id02860>Certainly, he would.</P>
<P id=id02861>And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among 
themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to 
remark which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were 
together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, 
do you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or envy the 
possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,</P>
<P id=id02862>Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,</P>
<P id=id02863>and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live 
after their manner?</P>
<P id=id02864>Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than 
entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.</P>
<P id=id02865>Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the 
sun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his 
eyes full of darkness?</P>
<P id=id02866>To be sure, he said.</P>
<P id=id02867>And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring 
the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his 
sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which 
would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable) 
would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he went and down he 
came without his eyes; and that it was better not even to think of ascending; 
and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light, let them 
only catch the offender, and they would put him to death.</P>
<P id=id02868>No question, he said.</P>
<P id=id02869>This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to 
the previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of the 
fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey 
upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my 
poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed whether rightly or wrongly 
God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of 
knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; 
and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things 
beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible 
world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and 
that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally, either in public 
or private life must have his eye fixed.</P>
<P id=id02870>I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.</P>
<P id=id02871>Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to 
this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls 
are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell; which desire 
of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.</P>
<P id=id02872>Yes, very natural.</P>
<P id=id02873>And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine 
contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous 
manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to 
the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other 
places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is 
endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute 
justice?</P>
<P id=id02874>Anything but surprising, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02875>Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments 
of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out 
of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, 
quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any 
one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will 
first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is 
unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness 
to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his 
condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind 
to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more 
reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of 
the light into the den.</P>
<P id=id02876>That, he said, is a very just distinction.</P>
<P id=id02877>But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be 
wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not 
there before, like sight into blind eyes.</P>
<P id=id02878>They undoubtedly say this, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02879>Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of 
learning exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn 
from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of 
knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of 
becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being, 
and of the brightest and best of being, or in other words, of the good.</P>
<P id=id02880>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02881>And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the 
easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that 
exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away 
from the truth?</P>
<P id=id02882>Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.</P>
<P id=id02883>And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be 
akin to bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can 
be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than anything else 
contains a divine element which always remains, and by this conversion is 
rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand, hurtful and useless. Did 
you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever 
rogue—how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he 
is the reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of 
evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness.</P>
<P id=id02884>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id02885>But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the 
days of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures, 
such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached to them 
at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon 
the things that are below—if, I say, they had been released from these 
impediments and turned in the opposite direction, the very same faculty in them 
would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to 
now.</P>
<P id=id02886>Very likely.</P>
<P id=id02887>Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather 
a necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated and 
uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of their education, 
will be able ministers of State; not the former, because they have no single aim 
of duty which is the rule of all their actions, private as well as public; nor 
the latter, because they will not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying 
that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.</P>
<P id=id02888>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02889>Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State 
will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already 
shown to be the greatest of all-they must continue to ascend until they arrive 
at the good; but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them 
to do as they do now.</P>
<P id=id02890>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id02891>I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be 
allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and 
partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not.</P>
<P id=id02892>But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse 
life, when they might have a better?</P>
<P id=id02893>You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the 
legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the 
rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held the citizens 
together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and 
therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please 
themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up the State.</P>
<P id=id02894>True, he said, I had forgotten.</P>
<P id=id02895>Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling 
our philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain to 
them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to share in the 
toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their own sweet 
will, and the government would rather not have them. Being self-taught, they 
cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never 
received. But we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive, kings 
of yourselves and of the other citizens, and have educated you far better and 
more perfectly than they have been educated, and you are better able to share in 
the double duty. Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the 
general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you 
have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the 
inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are, and what 
they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their 
truth. And thus our State which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream 
only, and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which 
men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle 
for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the 
State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and 
most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the 
worst.</P>
<P id=id02896>Quite true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02897>And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their 
turn at the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of 
their time with one another in the heavenly light?</P>
<P id=id02898>Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands 
which we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of them 
will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of our present 
rulers of State.</P>
<P id=id02899>Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must 
contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, 
and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which offers 
this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in virtue 
and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas if they go to the 
administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after the' own private 
advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good, order there 
can never be; for they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic 
broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the 
whole State.</P>
<P id=id02900>Most true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02901>And the only life which looks down upon the life of political 
ambition is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?</P>
<P id=id02902>Indeed, I do not, he said.</P>
<P id=id02903>And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if 
they are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.</P>
<P id=id02904>No question.</P>
<P id=id02905>Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely 
they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the 
State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and 
another and a better life than that of politics?</P>
<P id=id02906>They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02907>And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be 
produced, and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,—as some are 
said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?</P>
<P id=id02908>By all means, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02909>The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, 
but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than 
night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below, which we affirm 
to be true philosophy?</P>
<P id=id02910>Quite so.</P>
<P id=id02911>And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of 
effecting such a change?</P>
<P id=id02912>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02913>What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from 
becoming to being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will 
remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes</P>
<P id=id02914>Yes, that was said.</P>
<P id=id02915>Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional 
quality?</P>
<P id=id02916>What quality?</P>
<P id=id02917>Usefulness in war.</P>
<P id=id02918>Yes, if possible.</P>
<P id=id02919>There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there 
not?</P>
<P id=id02920>Just so.</P>
<P id=id02921>There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of 
the body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and 
corruption?</P>
<P id=id02922>True.</P>
<P id=id02923>Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover? 
No.</P>
<P id=id02924>But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain 
extent into our former scheme?</P>
<P id=id02925>Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of 
gymnastic, and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony 
making them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and 
the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of rhythm and 
harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which tended to that good which 
you are now seeking.</P>
<P id=id02926>You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music 
there certainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is there, 
my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts were 
reckoned mean by us?</P>
<P id=id02927>Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the 
arts are also excluded, what remains?</P>
<P id=id02928>Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; 
and then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of universal 
application.</P>
<P id=id02929>What may that be?</P>
<P id=id02930>A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in 
common, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of 
education.</P>
<P id=id02931>What is that?</P>
<P id=id02932>The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three—in a word, 
number and calculation:—do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of 
them?</P>
<P id=id02933>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02934>Then the art of war partakes of them?</P>
<P id=id02935>To the sure.</P>
<P id=id02936>Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon 
ridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares that he 
had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of 
the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been numbered before, and 
Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own 
feet—how could he if he was ignorant of number? And if that is true, what sort 
of general must he have been?</P>
<P id=id02937>I should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.</P>
<P id=id02938>Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of 
arithmetic?</P>
<P id=id02939>Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding 
of military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man at 
all.</P>
<P id=id02940>I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I 
have of this study?</P>
<P id=id02941>What is your notion?</P>
<P id=id02942>It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, 
and which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; 
for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.</P>
<P id=id02943>Will you explain your meaning? he said.</P>
<P id=id02944>I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with 
me, and say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what 
branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may have 
clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.</P>
<P id=id02945>Explain, he said.</P>
<P id=id02946>I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them 
do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while in 
the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is 
imperatively demanded.</P>
<P id=id02947>You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the 
senses are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.</P>
<P id=id02948>No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.</P>
<P id=id02949>Then what is your meaning?</P>
<P id=id02950>When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not 
pass from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in 
this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance or 
near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite. 
An illustration will make my meaning clearer:—here are three fingers—a little 
finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.</P>
<P id=id02951>Very good.</P>
<P id=id02952>You may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the 
point.</P>
<P id=id02953>What is it?</P>
<P id=id02954>Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle 
or at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin—it makes no 
difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is not 
compelled to ask of thought the question, what is a finger? for the sight never 
intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.</P>
<P id=id02955>True.</P>
<P id=id02956>And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here 
which invites or excites intelligence.</P>
<P id=id02957>There is not, he said.</P>
<P id=id02958>But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the 
fingers? Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the 
circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the 
extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities 
of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness? And so of the other senses; 
do they give perfect intimations of such matters? Is not their mode of operation 
on this wise—the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is 
necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to 
the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?</P>
<P id=id02959>You are quite right, he said.</P>
<P id=id02960>And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the 
sense gives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of light 
and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, 
light?</P>
<P id=id02961>Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very 
curious and require to be explained.</P>
<P id=id02962>Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons 
to her aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several 
objects announced to her are one or two.</P>
<P id=id02963>True.</P>
<P id=id02964>And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and 
different?</P>
<P id=id02965>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02966>And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as 
in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived 
of as one?</P>
<P id=id02967>True.</P>
<P id=id02968>The eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a 
confused manner; they were not distinguished.</P>
<P id=id02969>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02970>Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was 
compelled to reverse the process, and look at small and great as separate and 
not confused.</P>
<P id=id02971>Very true.</P>
<P id=id02972>Was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 
'What is small?'</P>
<P id=id02973>Exactly so.</P>
<P id=id02974>And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the 
intelligible.</P>
<P id=id02975>Most true.</P>
<P id=id02976>This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited 
the intellect, or the reverse—those which are simultaneous with opposite 
impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.</P>
<P id=id02977>I understand, he said, and agree with you.</P>
<P id=id02978>And to which class do unity and number belong?</P>
<P id=id02979>I do not know, he replied.</P>
<P id=id02980>Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply 
the answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by 
any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the finger, there would 
be nothing to attract towards being; but when there is some contradiction always 
present, and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality, 
then thought begins to be aroused within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting 
to arrive at a decision asks 'What is absolute unity?' This is the way in which 
the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the 
contemplation of true being.</P>
<P id=id02981>And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for 
we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?</P>
<P id=id02982>Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of 
all number?</P>
<P id=id02983>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02984>And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?</P>
<P id=id02985>Yes.</P>
<P id=id02986>And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?</P>
<P id=id02987>Yes, in a very remarkable manner.</P>
<P id=id02988>Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, 
having a double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn 
the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the 
philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold 
of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.</P>
<P id=id02989>That is true.</P>
<P id=id02990>And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?</P>
<P id=id02991>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id02992>Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly 
prescribe; and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the 
principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they 
must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only; 
nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying or selling, 
but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; and because 
this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and 
being.</P>
<P id=id02993>That is excellent, he said.</P>
<P id=id02994>Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming 
the science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if pursued 
in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!</P>
<P id=id02995>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id02996>I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and 
elevating effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and 
rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the 
argument. You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any 
one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating, and if you 
divide, they multiply, taking care that one shall continue one and not become 
lost in fractions.</P>
<P id=id02997>That is very true.</P>
<P id=id02998>Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are 
these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, 
there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, 
indivisible,—what would they answer?</P>
<P id=id02999>They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking 
of those numbers which can only be realised in thought.</P>
<P id=id03000>Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, 
necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the 
attainment of pure truth?</P>
<P id=id03001>Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.</P>
<P id=id03002>And have you further observed, that those who have a natural 
talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and 
even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may 
derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they would 
otherwise have been.</P>
<P id=id03003>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03004>And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and 
not many as difficult.</P>
<P id=id03005>You will not.</P>
<P id=id03006>And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in 
which the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.</P>
<P id=id03007>I agree.</P>
<P id=id03008>Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, 
shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?</P>
<P id=id03009>You mean geometry?</P>
<P id=id03010>Exactly so.</P>
<P id=id03011>Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry 
which relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or 
closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military manoeuvre, 
whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the difference whether 
a general is or is not a geometrician.</P>
<P id=id03012>Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry 
or calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater and 
more advanced part of geometry—whether that tends in any degree to make more 
easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was saying, all things 
tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place, where is the 
full perfection of being, which she ought, by all means, to behold.</P>
<P id=id03013>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id03014>Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if 
becoming only, it does not concern us?</P>
<P id=id03015>Yes, that is what we assert.</P>
<P id=id03016>Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not 
deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the 
ordinary language of geometricians.</P>
<P id=id03017>How so?</P>
<P id=id03018>They have in view practice only, and are always speaking? in a 
narrow and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the 
like—they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life; whereas 
knowledge is the real object of the whole science.</P>
<P id=id03019>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id03020>Then must not a further admission be made?</P>
<P id=id03021>What admission?</P>
<P id=id03022>That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the 
eternal, and not of aught perishing and transient.</P>
<P id=id03023>That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.</P>
<P id=id03024>Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, 
and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now unhappily 
allowed to fall down.</P>
<P id=id03025>Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.</P>
<P id=id03026>Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the 
inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the 
science has indirect effects, which are not small.</P>
<P id=id03027>Of what kind? he said.</P>
<P id=id03028>There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and 
in all departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied 
geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.</P>
<P id=id03029>Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between 
them.</P>
<P id=id03030>Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which 
our youth will study?</P>
<P id=id03031>Let us do so, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03032>And suppose we make astronomy the third—what do you say?</P>
<P id=id03033>I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the 
seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the 
farmer or sailor.</P>
<P id=id03034>I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you 
guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite 
admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul 
which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these purified and 
re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes, for by it 
alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of persons: one class of those 
who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation; another class 
to whom they will be utterly unmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be 
idle tales, for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. 
And therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are 
proposing to argue. You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief 
aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same time you do 
not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.</P>
<P id=id03035>I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my 
own behalf.</P>
<P id=id03036>Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of 
the sciences.</P>
<P id=id03037>What was the mistake? he said.</P>
<P id=id03038>After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in 
revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the second 
dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth, 
ought to have followed.</P>
<P id=id03039>That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet 
about these subjects.</P>
<P id=id03040>Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons:—in the first place, no 
government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of 
them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students cannot learn them 
unless they have a director. But then a director can hardly be found, and even 
if he could, as matters now stand, the students, who are very conceited, would 
not attend to him. That, however, would be otherwise if the whole State became 
the director of these studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want 
to come, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries would 
be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world, and maimed of 
their fair proportions, and although none of their votaries can tell the use of 
them, still these studies force their way by their natural charm, and very 
likely, if they had the help of the State, they would some day emerge into 
light.</P>
<P id=id03041>Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not 
clearly understand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry of 
plane surfaces?</P>
<P id=id03042>Yes, I said.</P>
<P id=id03043>And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step 
backward?</P>
<P id=id03044>Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of 
solid geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over 
this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.</P>
<P id=id03045>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id03046>Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into 
existence if encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be 
fourth.</P>
<P id=id03047>The right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the 
vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall be given in 
your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that astronomy compels the 
soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.</P>
<P id=id03048>Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, 
but not to me.</P>
<P id=id03049>And what then would you say?</P>
<P id=id03050>I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into 
philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.</P>
<P id=id03051>What do you mean? he asked.</P>
<P id=id03052>You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of 
our knowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were to throw 
his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think that his mind 
was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very likely right, and I may 
be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that knowledge only which is of being and of 
the unseen can make the soul look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the 
heavens or blinks on the ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I 
would deny that he can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his 
soul is looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water 
or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.</P>
<P id=id03053>I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I 
should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more 
conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?</P>
<P id=id03054>I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is 
wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most 
perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true 
motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each 
other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number 
and in every true figure. Now, these are to be apprehended by reason and 
intelligence, but not by sight.</P>
<P id=id03055>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03056>The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view 
to that higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures 
excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist, which 
we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the 
exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never dream of thinking that in 
them he could find the true equal or the true double, or the truth of any other 
proportion.</P>
<P id=id03057>No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.</P>
<P id=id03058>And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks 
at the movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things in 
heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner? But he will 
never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of both to the month, or 
of the month to the year, or of the stars to these and to one another, and any 
other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no 
deviation—that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains 
in investigating their exact truth.</P>
<P id=id03059>I quite agree, though I never thought of this before.</P>
<P id=id03060>Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ 
problems, and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the 
right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.</P>
<P id=id03061>That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present 
astronomers.</P>
<P id=id03062>Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have 
a similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any value. But 
can you tell me of any other suitable study?</P>
<P id=id03063>No, he said, not without thinking.</P>
<P id=id03064>Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are 
obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others, as I 
imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.</P>
<P id=id03065>But where are the two?</P>
<P id=id03066>There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one 
already named.</P>
<P id=id03067>And what may that be?</P>
<P id=id03068>The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what 
the first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look 
up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these are 
sister sciences—as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with them?</P>
<P id=id03069>Yes, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03070>But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had 
better go and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other 
applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight of our 
own higher object.</P>
<P id=id03071>What is that?</P>
<P id=id03072>There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and 
which our pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying 
that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you probably know, 
the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare the sounds and 
consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that of the 
astronomers, is in vain.</P>
<P id=id03073>Yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them 
talking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears 
close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their 
neighbour's wall—one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate 
note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement; 
the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same—either party 
setting their ears before their understanding.</P>
<P id=id03074>You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the 
strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument: might carry on the metaphor 
and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and make 
accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and forwardness to sound; 
but this would be tedious, and therefore I will only say that these are not the 
men, and that I am referring to the Pythagoreans, of whom I was just now 
proposing to enquire about harmony. For they too are in error, like the 
astronomers; they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but 
they never attain to problems-that is to say, they never reach the natural 
harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others 
not.</P>
<P id=id03075>That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.</P>
<P id=id03076>A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if 
sought after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other 
spirit, useless. Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03077>Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and 
connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual 
affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them have a 
value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.</P>
<P id=id03078>I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.</P>
<P id=id03079>What do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know 
that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? 
For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?</P>
<P id=id03080>Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician 
who was capable of reasoning.</P>
<P id=id03081>But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a 
reason will have the knowledge which we require of them?</P>
<P id=id03082>Neither can this be supposed.</P>
<P id=id03083>And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of 
dialectic. This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which the 
faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight, as you may 
remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars, 
and last of all the sun himself. And so with dialectic; when a person starts on 
the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only, and without any 
assistance of sense, and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the 
perception of the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the 
intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.</P>
<P id=id03084>Exactly, he said.</P>
<P id=id03085>Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?</P>
<P id=id03086>True.</P>
<P id=id03087>But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their 
translation from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from 
the underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying to 
look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to perceive 
even with their weak eyes the images in the water (which are divine), and are 
the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images cast by a light of fire, 
which compared with the sun is only an image)—this power of elevating the 
highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in 
existence, with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the 
very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material 
and visible world—this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and 
pursuit of the arts which has been described.</P>
<P id=id03088>I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to 
believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This, 
however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have to be 
discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true or false, let 
us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the 
chief strain, and describe that in like manner. Say, then, what is the nature 
and what are the divisions of dialectic, and what are the paths which lead 
thither; for these paths will also lead to our final rest?</P>
<P id=id03089>Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, 
though I would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the 
absolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would or would 
not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would have seen 
something like reality; of that I am confident.</P>
<P id=id03090>Doubtless, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03091>But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can 
reveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.</P>
<P id=id03092>Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.</P>
<P id=id03093>And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of 
comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what 
each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in general are concerned with the 
desires or opinions of men, or are cultivated with a view to production and 
construction, or for the preservation of such productions and constructions; and 
as to the mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension 
of true being—geometry and the like—they only dream about being, but never can 
they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they 
use unexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. For when a man knows 
not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are 
also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric 
of convention can ever become science?</P>
<P id=id03094>Impossible, he said.</P>
<P id=id03095>Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first 
principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to 
make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally buried in an 
outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses as 
handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences which we have been 
discussing. Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have some other name, 
implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science: and 
this, in our previous sketch, was called understanding. But why should we 
dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider?</P>
<P id=id03096>Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the 
thought of the mind with clearness?</P>
<P id=id03097>At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; 
two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, 
the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of 
shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being; and so 
to make a proportion:—</P>
<P id=id03098>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As being is to becoming, so is pure 
intellect to opinion.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as intellect is to opinion, 
so is science to belief, and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding to the 
perception of shadows.<BR></P>
<P id=id03099>But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the 
subjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times 
longer than this has been.</P>
<P id=id03100>As far as I understand, he said, I agree.</P>
<P id=id03101>And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as 
one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does not 
possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he 
fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence? Will you admit 
so much?</P>
<P id=id03102>Yes, he said; how can I deny it?</P>
<P id=id03103>And you would say the same of the conception of the good?</P>
<P id=id03104>Until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the 
idea of good, and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready 
to disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never 
faltering at any step of the argument—unless he can do all this, you would say 
that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he apprehends only a 
shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion and not by 
science;—dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is well awake here, he 
arrives at the world below, and has his final quietus.</P>
<P id=id03105>In all that I should most certainly agree with you.</P>
<P id=id03106>And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, 
whom you are nurturing and educating—if the ideal ever becomes a reality—you 
would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having no reason in them, 
and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?</P>
<P id=id03107>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id03108>Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as 
will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering 
questions?</P>
<P id=id03109>Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.</P>
<P id=id03110>Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the 
sciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher—the nature 
of knowledge can no further go?</P>
<P id=id03111>I agree, he said.</P>
<P id=id03112>But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they 
are to be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?</P>
<P id=id03113>Yes, clearly.</P>
<P id=id03114>You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?</P>
<P id=id03115>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id03116>The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again 
given to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and, 
having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural gifts which 
will facilitate their education.</P>
<P id=id03117>And what are these?</P>
<P id=id03118>Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the 
mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of 
gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared with the 
body.</P>
<P id=id03119>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03120>Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, 
and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will 
never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through 
all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him.</P>
<P id=id03121>Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.</P>
<P id=id03122>The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no 
vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has fallen 
into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards.</P>
<P id=id03123>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id03124>In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting 
industry—I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as, for 
example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all other bodily 
exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or 
listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of 
an opposite kind, and he may have the other sort of lameness.</P>
<P id=id03125>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id03126>And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt 
and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself 
and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary falsehood, and 
does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance, and has 
no shame at being detected?</P>
<P id=id03127>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id03128>And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and 
every other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and 
the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities States and 
individuals unconsciously err and the State makes a ruler, and the individual a 
friend, of one who, being defective in some part of virtue, is in a figure lame 
or a bastard.</P>
<P id=id03129>That is very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03130>All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by 
us; and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and 
training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing to say 
against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the State; 
but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse will happen, and we 
shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to 
endure at present.</P>
<P id=id03131>That would not be creditable.</P>
<P id=id03132>Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into 
earnest I am equally ridiculous.</P>
<P id=id03133>In what respect?</P>
<P id=id03134>I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with 
too much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under 
foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her 
disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.</P>
<P id=id03135>Indeed! I was listening, and did not think so.</P>
<P id=id03136>But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind 
you that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do so 
in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old 
may learn many things—for he can no more learn much than he can run much; youth 
is the time for any extraordinary toil.</P>
<P id=id03137>Of course.</P>
<P id=id03138>And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other 
elements of instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be 
presented to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing 
our system of education.</P>
<P id=id03139>Why not?</P>
<P id=id03140>Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of 
knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the 
body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the 
mind.</P>
<P id=id03141>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03142>Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early 
education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find out the 
natural bent.</P>
<P id=id03143>That is a very rational notion, he said.</P>
<P id=id03144>Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see 
the battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be 
brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given them?</P>
<P id=id03145>Yes, I remember.</P>
<P id=id03146>The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these 
things—labours, lessons, dangers—and he who is most at home in all of them ought 
to be enrolled in a select number.</P>
<P id=id03147>At what age?</P>
<P id=id03148>At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period 
whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless 
for any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning; and 
the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important 
tests to which our youth are subjected.</P>
<P id=id03149>Certainly, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03150>After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty 
years old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they learned 
without any order in their early education will now be brought together, and 
they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to 
true being.</P>
<P id=id03151>Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes 
lasting root.</P>
<P id=id03152>Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great 
criterion of dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the 
dialectical.</P>
<P id=id03153>I agree with you, he said.</P>
<P id=id03154>These, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those 
who have most of this comprehension, and who are more steadfast in their 
learning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they have 
arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class, 
and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove them by the help of 
dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight 
and the other senses, and in company with truth to attain absolute being: And 
here, my friend, great caution is required.</P>
<P id=id03155>Why great caution?</P>
<P id=id03156>Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic 
has introduced?</P>
<P id=id03157>What evil? he said.</P>
<P id=id03158>The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.</P>
<P id=id03159>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03160>Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or 
inexcusable in their case? or will you make allowance for them?</P>
<P id=id03161>In what way make allowance?</P>
<P id=id03162>I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a 
supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and 
numerous family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns 
that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is unable to 
discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers 
and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of 
the false relation, and then again when he knows? Or shall I guess for you?</P>
<P id=id03163>If you please.</P>
<P id=id03164>Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will 
be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more 
than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need, or 
to do or say anything against them; and he will be less willing to disobey them 
in any important matter.</P>
<P id=id03165>He will.</P>
<P id=id03166>But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would 
diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted to the 
flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he would now live 
after their ways, and openly associate with them, and, unless he were of an 
unusually good disposition, he would trouble himself no more about his supposed 
parents or other relations.</P>
<P id=id03167>Well, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable 
to the disciples of philosophy?</P>
<P id=id03168>In this way: you know that there are certain principles about 
justice and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental 
authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.</P>
<P id=id03169>That is true.</P>
<P id=id03170>There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which 
flatter and attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any 
sense of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their 
fathers.</P>
<P id=id03171>True.</P>
<P id=id03172>Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks 
what is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him, and 
then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven into 
believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable, or just and 
good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions which he most valued, 
do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before?</P>
<P id=id03173>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id03174>And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as 
heretofore, and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any 
life other than that which flatters his desires?</P>
<P id=id03175>He cannot.</P>
<P id=id03176>And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker 
of it?</P>
<P id=id03177>Unquestionably.</P>
<P id=id03178>Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I 
have described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.</P>
<P id=id03179>Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.</P>
<P id=id03180>Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our 
citizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in 
introducing them to dialectic.</P>
<P id=id03181>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03182>There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too 
early; for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste 
in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and refuting 
others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs, they rejoice in 
pulling and tearing at all who come near them.</P>
<P id=id03183>Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.</P>
<P id=id03184>And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the 
hands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing 
anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but philosophy 
and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the 
world.</P>
<P id=id03185>Too true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03186>But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of 
such insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and 
not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the greater 
moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of 
the pursuit.</P>
<P id=id03187>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03188>And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that 
the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, any 
chance aspirant or intruder?</P>
<P id=id03189>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03190>Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of 
gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for 
twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise—will that be 
enough?</P>
<P id=id03191>Would you say six or four years? he asked.</P>
<P id=id03192>Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be 
sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office 
which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their 
experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether, when 
they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand firm or 
flinch.</P>
<P id=id03193>And how long is this stage of their lives to last?</P>
<P id=id03194>Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years 
of age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in 
every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to 
their consummation; the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of 
the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, and behold the 
absolute good; for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the 
State and the lives of individuals, and the remainder of their own lives also; 
making philosophy their chief pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also 
at politics and ruling for the public good, not as though they were performing 
some heroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought 
up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be 
governors of the State, then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and 
dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and 
honour them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as demi-gods, but if not, as in any 
case blessed and divine.</P>
<P id=id03195>You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our 
governors faultless in beauty.</P>
<P id=id03196>Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not 
suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far 
as their natures can go.</P>
<P id=id03197>There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in 
all things like the men.</P>
<P id=id03198>Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has 
been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although 
difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; 
that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one or more 
of them, despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and 
worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from 
right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, 
whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they 
set in order their own city?</P>
<P id=id03199>How will they proceed?</P>
<P id=id03200>They will begin by sending out into the country all the 
inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take 
possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their 
parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws 
which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we 
were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation 
which has such a constitution will gain most.</P>
<P id=id03201>Yes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you 
have very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into 
being.</P>
<P id=id03202>Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its 
image—there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.</P>
<P id=id03203>There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in 
thinking that nothing more need be said.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id03204>BOOK VIII</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id03205>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H4>
<P id=id03206>AND so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the 
perfect State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education and 
the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers 
and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?</P>
<P id=id03207>That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.</P>
<P id=id03208>Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, 
when appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses 
such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing 
private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we 
agreed?</P>
<P id=id03209>Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary 
possessions of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, 
receiving from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their 
maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole 
State.</P>
<P id=id03210>True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, 
let us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the old 
path.</P>
<P id=id03211>There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, 
that you had finished the description of the State: you said that such a State 
was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, as now 
appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and man. And you 
said further, that if this was the true form, then the others were false; and of 
the false forms, you said, as I remember, that there were four principal ones, 
and that their defects, and the defects of the individuals corresponding to 
them, were worth examining. When we had seen all the individuals, and finally 
agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them, we were to consider 
whether the best was not also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I 
asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke, and then 
Polemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word; and you began again, and have 
found your way to the point at which we have now arrived.</P>
<P id=id03212>Your recollection, I said, is most exact.</P>
<P id=id03213>Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in 
the same position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the 
same answer which you were about to give me then.</P>
<P id=id03214>Yes, if I can, I will, I said.</P>
<P id=id03215>I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions 
of which you were speaking.</P>
<P id=id03216>That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of 
which I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of Crete 
and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy comes next; 
this is not equally approved, and is a form of government which teems with 
evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, although very 
different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which differs from them 
all, and is the fourth and worst disorder of a State. I do not know, do you? of 
any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character. There are 
lordships and principalities which are bought and sold, and some other 
intermediate forms of government. But these are nondescripts and may be found 
equally among Hellenes and among barbarians.</P>
<P id=id03217>Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of 
government which exist among them.</P>
<P id=id03218>Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of 
men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other? 
For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out of the 
human natures which are in them, and which in a figure turn the scale and draw 
other things after them?</P>
<P id=id03219>Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of 
human characters.</P>
<P id=id03220>Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of 
individual minds will also be five?</P>
<P id=id03221>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03222>Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and 
good, we have already described.</P>
<P id=id03223>We have.</P>
<P id=id03224>Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, 
being the contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also the 
oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most just by the 
side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be able to compare the 
relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or 
pure injustice. The enquiry will then be completed. And we shall know whether we 
ought to pursue injustice, as Thrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the 
conclusions of the argument to prefer justice.</P>
<P id=id03225>Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.</P>
<P id=id03226>Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to 
clearness, of taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and 
begin with the government of honour?—I know of no name for such a government 
other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare with this the like 
character in the individual; and, after that, consider oligarchical man; and 
then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man; and 
lastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a look into 
the tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision.</P>
<P id=id03227>That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very 
suitable.</P>
<P id=id03228>First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government 
of honour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best). Clearly, all 
political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power; a 
government which is united, however small, cannot be moved.</P>
<P id=id03229>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03230>In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner the 
two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one 
another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us 'how 
discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to play and jest 
with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty tragic vein, making 
believe to be in earnest?</P>
<P id=id03231>How would they address us?</P>
<P id=id03232>After this manner:—A city which is thus constituted can hardly be 
shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end, even 
a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time be 
dissolved. And this is the dissolution:—In plants that grow in the earth, as 
well as in animals that move on the earth's surface, fertility and sterility of 
soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are 
completed, which in short-lived existences pass over a short space, and in 
long-lived ones over a long space. But to the knowledge of human fecundity and 
sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain; the laws 
which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed 
with sense, but will escape them, and they will bring children into the world 
when they ought not. Now that which is of divine birth has a period which is 
contained in a perfect number, but the period of human birth is comprehended in 
a number in which first increments by involution and evolution (or squared and 
cubed) obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and 
waning numbers, make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. 
The base of these (3) with a third added (4) when combined with five (20) and 
raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is a 
hundred times as great (400 = 4 X 100), and the other a figure having one side 
equal to the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon 
rational diameters of a square (i. e. omitting fractions), the side of which is 
five (7 X 7 = 49 X 100 = 4900), each of them being less by one (than the perfect 
square which includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less by two perfect squares of 
irrational diameters (of a square the side of which is five = 50 + 50 = 100); 
and a hundred cubes of three (27 X 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this 
number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil 
of births. For when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite 
bride and bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or 
fortunate. And though only the best of them will be appointed by their 
predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and 
when they come into power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in 
taking care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect will 
soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State will be less 
cultivated. In the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost 
the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races, which, like 
Hesiod's, are of gold and silver and brass and iron. And so iron will be mingled 
with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and 
inequality and irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred 
and war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung, 
wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.</P>
<P id=id03233>Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.</P>
<P id=id03234>Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses 
speak falsely?</P>
<P id=id03235>And what do the Muses say next?</P>
<P id=id03236>When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: 
the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and 
silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the true 
riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of 
things. There was a battle between them, and at last they agreed to distribute 
their land and houses among individual owners; and they enslaved their friends 
and maintainers, whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen, 
and made of them subjects and servants; and they themselves were engaged in war 
and in keeping a watch against them.</P>
<P id=id03237>I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the 
change.</P>
<P id=id03238>And the new government which thus arises will be of a form 
intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy?</P>
<P id=id03239>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03240>Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how 
will they proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy and 
the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and will also 
have some peculiarities.</P>
<P id=id03241>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id03242>In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior 
class from agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution of 
common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training—in 
all these respects this State will resemble the former.</P>
<P id=id03243>True.</P>
<P id=id03244>But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they 
are no longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements; 
and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who are by 
nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by them upon 
military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of everlasting wars—this 
State will be for the most part peculiar.</P>
<P id=id03245>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03246>Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like 
those who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing after 
gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines and 
treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them; also castles 
which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they will spend large sums on 
their wives, or on any others whom they please.</P>
<P id=id03247>That is most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03248>And they are miserly because they have no means of openly 
acquiring the money which they prize; they will spend that which is another 
man's on the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and 
running away like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled 
not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her who is the 
true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have honoured gymnastic 
more than music.</P>
<P id=id03249>Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is 
a mixture of good and evil.</P>
<P id=id03250>Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing 
only, is predominantly seen,—the spirit of contention and ambition; and these 
are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.</P>
<P id=id03251>Assuredly, he said.</P>
<P id=id03252>Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has 
been described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required, for 
a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most 
perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the characters of 
men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable labour.</P>
<P id=id03253>Very true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03254>Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come 
into being, and what is he like?</P>
<H5 id=id03255>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS</H5>
<P id=id03256>I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which 
characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.</P>
<P id=id03257>Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there 
are other respects in which he is very different.</P>
<P id=id03258>In what respects?</P>
<P id=id03259>He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and 
yet a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker. Such 
a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man, who is too 
proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and remarkably 
obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of honour; claiming to 
be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any ground of that sort, but 
because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms; he is also a lover of 
gymnastic exercises and of the chase.</P>
<P id=id03260>Yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.</P>
<P id=id03261>Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he 
gets older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a piece of 
the avaricious nature in him, and is not singleminded towards virtue, having 
lost his best guardian.</P>
<P id=id03262>Who was that? said Adeimantus.</P>
<P id=id03263>Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes her 
abode in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.</P>
<P id=id03264>Good, he said.</P>
<P id=id03265>Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the 
timocratical State.</P>
<P id=id03266>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id03267>His origin is as follows:—He is often the young son of a grave 
father, who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours and 
offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is ready to 
waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.</P>
<P id=id03268>And how does the son come into being?</P>
<P id=id03269>The character of the son begins to develop when he hears his 
mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which the 
consequence is that she has no precedence among other women. Further, when she 
sees her husband not very eager about money, and instead of battling and railing 
in the law courts or assembly, taking whatever happens to him quietly; and when 
she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself, while he treats her 
with very considerable indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that 
his father is only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other 
complaints about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of 
rehearsing.</P>
<P id=id03270>Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their 
complaints are so like themselves.</P>
<P id=id03271>And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed 
to be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same 
strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father, or is 
wronging him in any way, and he falls to prosecute them, they tell the youth 
that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort, and be more of 
a man than his father. He has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same 
sort of thing: those who do their own business in the city are called 
simpletons, and held in no esteem, while the busy-bodies are honoured and 
applauded. The result is that the young man, hearing and seeing all these 
thing—hearing too, the words of his father, and having a nearer view of his way 
of life, and making comparisons of him and others—is drawn opposite ways: while 
his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul, the 
others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being not 
originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last brought by 
their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the kingdom which is 
within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion, and becomes 
arrogant and ambitious.</P>
<P id=id03272>You seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.</P>
<P id=id03273>Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the 
second type of character?</P>
<P id=id03274>We have.</P>
<P id=id03275>Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,</P>
<P id=id03276>Is set over against another State;</P>
<P id=id03277>or rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.</P>
<P id=id03278>By all means.</P>
<P id=id03279>I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.</P>
<P id=id03280>And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?</P>
<P id=id03281>A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich 
have power and the poor man is deprived of it.</P>
<P id=id03282>I understand, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03283>Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy 
to oligarchy arises?</P>
<P id=id03284>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03285>Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one 
passes into the other.</P>
<P id=id03286>How?</P>
<P id=id03287>The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is 
ruin the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do 
they or their wives care about the law?</P>
<P id=id03288>Yes, indeed.</P>
<P id=id03289>And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and 
thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.</P>
<P id=id03290>Likely enough.</P>
<P id=id03291>And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of 
making a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are 
placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the other 
falls.</P>
<P id=id03292>True.</P>
<P id=id03293>And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the 
State, virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.</P>
<P id=id03294>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03295>And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour 
is neglected.</P>
<P id=id03296>That is obvious.</P>
<P id=id03297>And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become 
lovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and make a 
ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.</P>
<P id=id03298>They do so.</P>
<P id=id03299>They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the 
qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower in 
another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow no one whose 
property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government. These 
changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms, if intimidation has 
not already done their work.</P>
<P id=id03300>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03301>And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is 
established.</P>
<P id=id03302>Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of 
government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?</P>
<P id=id03303>First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification 
just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their 
property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though he were a 
better pilot?</P>
<P id=id03304>You mean that they would shipwreck?</P>
<P id=id03305>Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?</P>
<P id=id03306>I should imagine so.</P>
<P id=id03307>Except a city?—or would you include a city?</P>
<P id=id03308>Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch 
as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.</P>
<P id=id03309>This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?</P>
<P id=id03310>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03311>And here is another defect which is quite as bad.</P>
<P id=id03312>What defect?</P>
<P id=id03313>The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, 
the one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot and 
always conspiring against one another.</P>
<P id=id03314>That, surely, is at least as bad.</P>
<P id=id03315>Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they 
are incapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and then 
they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not call them out 
in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to fight as they are few 
to rule. And at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to 
pay taxes.</P>
<P id=id03316>How discreditable!</P>
<P id=id03317>And, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons 
have too many callings—they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one. 
Does that look well?</P>
<P id=id03318>Anything but well.</P>
<P id=id03319>There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and 
to which this State first begins to be liable.</P>
<P id=id03320>What evil?</P>
<P id=id03321>A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his 
property; yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a 
part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but only a 
poor, helpless creature.</P>
<P id=id03322>Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.</P>
<P id=id03323>The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have 
both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.</P>
<P id=id03324>True.</P>
<P id=id03325>But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his 
money, was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of 
citizenship? Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body, although in 
truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a spendthrift?</P>
<P id=id03326>As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a 
spendthrift.</P>
<P id=id03327>May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the 
drone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the other 
is of the hive?</P>
<P id=id03328>Just so, Socrates.</P>
<P id=id03329>And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without 
stings, whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others 
have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old age end 
as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal class, as they are termed.</P>
<P id=id03330>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03331>Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in 
that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cutpurses and robbers of 
temples, and all sorts of malefactors.</P>
<P id=id03332>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03333>Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find 
paupers?</P>
<P id=id03334>Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.</P>
<P id=id03335>And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many 
criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities 
are careful to restrain by force?</P>
<P id=id03336>Certainly, we may be so bold.</P>
<P id=id03337>The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of 
education, ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?</P>
<P id=id03338>True.</P>
<P id=id03339>Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and 
there may be many other evils.</P>
<P id=id03340>Very likely.</P>
<P id=id03341>Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are 
elected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to consider 
the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this State.</P>
<P id=id03342>By all means.</P>
<P id=id03343>Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this 
wise?</P>
<P id=id03344>How?</P>
<P id=id03345>A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at 
first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but 
presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon a sunken 
reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a general or some 
other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by 
informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the privileges of 
a citizen, and all his property taken from him.</P>
<P id=id03346>Nothing more likely.</P>
<P id=id03347>And the son has seen and known all this—he is a ruined man, and 
his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion head-foremost from his 
bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean and 
miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such an one likely 
to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer 
it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara and chain and 
scimitar?</P>
<P id=id03348>Most true, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03349>And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground 
obediently on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their 
place, he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into 
larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but 
riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition 
of wealth and the means of acquiring it.</P>
<P id=id03350>Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the 
conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.</P>
<P id=id03351>And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?</P>
<P id=id03352>Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is 
like the State out of which oligarchy came.</P>
<P id=id03353>Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between 
them.</P>
<P id=id03354>Very good.</P>
<P id=id03355>First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set 
upon wealth?</P>
<P id=id03356>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03357>Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only 
satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them; his 
other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.</P>
<P id=id03358>True.</P>
<P id=id03359>He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and 
makes a purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud. 
Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?</P>
<P id=id03360>He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by 
him as well as by the State.</P>
<P id=id03361>You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.</P>
<P id=id03362>I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have 
made a blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.</P>
<P id=id03363>Excellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that 
owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires 
as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of 
life?</P>
<P id=id03364>True.</P>
<P id=id03365>Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover 
his rogueries?</P>
<P id=id03366>Where must I look?</P>
<P id=id03367>You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting 
dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.</P>
<P id=id03368>Aye.</P>
<P id=id03369>It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which 
give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced 
virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by reason, but 
by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he trembles for his 
possessions.</P>
<P id=id03370>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id03371>Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural 
desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend 
what is not his own.</P>
<P id=id03372>Yes, and they will be strong in him too.</P>
<P id=id03373>The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, 
and not one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over 
his inferior ones.</P>
<P id=id03374>True.</P>
<P id=id03375>For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most 
people; yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far 
away and never come near him.</P>
<P id=id03376>I should expect so.</P>
<P id=id03377>And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor 
in a State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition; he 
will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of awakening 
his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle; in 
true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources, and 
the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money.</P>
<P id=id03378>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03379>Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker 
answers to the oligarchical State?</P>
<P id=id03380>There can be no doubt.</P>
<P id=id03381>Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to 
be considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic 
man, and bring him up for judgement.</P>
<P id=id03382>That, he said, is our method.</P>
<P id=id03383>Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into 
democracy arise? Is it not on this wise?—The good at which such a State alms is 
to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?</P>
<P id=id03384>What then?</P>
<P id=id03385>The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, 
refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they 
gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates and 
thus increase their own wealth and importance?</P>
<P id=id03386>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id03387>There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of 
moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same State to any 
considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.</P>
<P id=id03388>That is tolerably clear.</P>
<P id=id03389>And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of 
carelessness and extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to 
beggary?</P>
<P id=id03390>Yes, often.</P>
<P id=id03391>And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting 
and fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their 
citizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and conspire 
against those who have got their property, and against everybody else, and are 
eager for revolution.</P>
<P id=id03392>That is true.</P>
<P id=id03393>On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and 
pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert their 
sting—that is, their money—into some one else who is not on his guard against 
them, and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of 
children: and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the State.</P>
<P id=id03394>Yes, he said, there are plenty of them—that is certain.</P>
<P id=id03395>The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, 
either by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:</P>
<P id=id03396>What other?</P>
<P id=id03397>One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling 
the citizens to look to their characters:—Let there be a general rule that every 
one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there will be less 
of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which we were speaking will be 
greatly lessened in the State.</P>
<P id=id03398>Yes, they will be greatly lessened.</P>
<P id=id03399>At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have 
named, treat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially 
the young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of luxury 
and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable of 
resisting either pleasure or pain.</P>
<P id=id03400>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03401>They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent 
as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.</P>
<P id=id03402>Yes, quite as indifferent.</P>
<P id=id03403>Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often 
rulers and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a pilgrimage 
or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye, and they may observe the 
behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger—for where danger is, there 
is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich—and very likely the wiry 
sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has 
never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh—when he sees 
such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can he avoid drawing the 
conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to 
despoil them? And when they meet in private will not people be saying to one 
another 'Our warriors are not good for much'?</P>
<P id=id03404>Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of 
talking.</P>
<P id=id03405>And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from 
without may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external 
provocation a commotion may arise within-in the same way wherever there is 
weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness, of which the occasions 
may be very slight, the one party introducing from without their oligarchical, 
the other their democratical allies, and then the State falls sick, and is at 
war with herself; and may be at times distracted, even when there is no external 
cause.</P>
<P id=id03406>Yes, surely.</P>
<P id=id03407>And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered 
their opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder 
they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of 
government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.</P>
<P id=id03408>Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the 
revolution has been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite 
party to withdraw.</P>
<P id=id03409>And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a 
government have they? for as the government is, such will be the man.</P>
<P id=id03410>Clearly, he said.</P>
<P id=id03411>In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of 
freedom and frankness—a man may say and do what he likes?</P>
<P id=id03412>'Tis said so, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03413>And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for 
himself his own life as he pleases?</P>
<P id=id03414>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03415>Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of 
human natures?</P>
<P id=id03416>There will.</P>
<P id=id03417>This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being an 
embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just as women 
and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming, so 
there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with the manners and 
characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of States.</P>
<P id=id03418>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03419>Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for 
a government.</P>
<P id=id03420>Why?</P>
<P id=id03421>Because of the liberty which reigns there—they have a complete 
assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we 
have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they 
sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made his 
choice, he may found his State.</P>
<P id=id03422>He will be sure to have patterns enough.</P>
<P id=id03423>And there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this 
State, even if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or go 
to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at peace, 
unless you are so disposed—there being no necessity also, because some law 
forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you should not hold office or be 
a dicast, if you have a fancy—is not this a way of life which for the moment is 
supremely delightful</P>
<P id=id03424>For the moment, yes.</P>
<P id=id03425>And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite 
charming? Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they 
have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk about 
the world—the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or cares?</P>
<P id=id03426>Yes, he replied, many and many a one.</P>
<P id=id03427>See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't 
care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine 
principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city—as when we 
said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature, there never will be 
a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of 
beauty and make of them a joy and a study—how grandly does she trample all these 
fine notions of ours under her feet, never giving a thought to the pursuits 
which make a statesman, and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the 
people's friend.</P>
<P id=id03428>Yes, she is of a noble spirit.</P>
<P id=id03429>These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, 
which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and 
dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.</P>
<P id=id03430>We know her well.</P>
<P id=id03431>Consider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or 
rather consider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.</P>
<P id=id03432>Very good, he said.</P>
<P id=id03433>Is not this the way—he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical 
father who has trained him in his own habits?</P>
<P id=id03434>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id03435>And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which 
are of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called 
unnecessary?</P>
<P id=id03436>Obviously.</P>
<P id=id03437>Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which 
are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?</P>
<P id=id03438>I should.</P>
<P id=id03439>Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and 
of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly so, because 
we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary, 
and cannot help it.</P>
<P id=id03440>True.</P>
<P id=id03441>We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?</P>
<P id=id03442>We are not.</P>
<P id=id03443>And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from 
his youth upwards—of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in some 
cases the reverse of good—shall we not be right in saying that all these are 
unnecessary?</P>
<P id=id03444>Yes, certainly.</P>
<P id=id03445>Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may 
have a general notion of them?</P>
<P id=id03446>Very good.</P>
<P id=id03447>Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and 
condiments, in so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the 
necessary class?</P>
<P id=id03448>That is what I should suppose.</P>
<P id=id03449>The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good 
and it is essential to the continuance of life?</P>
<P id=id03450>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03451>But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good 
for health?</P>
<P id=id03452>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03453>And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or 
other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained 
in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of 
wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?</P>
<P id=id03454>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03455>May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make 
money because they conduce to production?</P>
<P id=id03456>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03457>And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same 
holds good?</P>
<P id=id03458>True.</P>
<P id=id03459>And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in 
pleasures and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary 
desires, whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and 
oligarchical?</P>
<P id=id03460>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03461>Again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the 
oligarchical: the following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.</P>
<P id=id03462>What is the process?</P>
<P id=id03463>When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now 
describing, in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come 
to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all 
sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure—then, as you may imagine, the 
change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the 
democratical?</P>
<P id=id03464>Inevitably.</P>
<P id=id03465>And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was 
effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so 
too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist 
the desires within him, that which is and alike again helping that which is akin 
and alike?</P>
<P id=id03466>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03467>And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle 
within him, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or 
rebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction, 
and he goes to war with himself.</P>
<P id=id03468>It must be so.</P>
<P id=id03469>And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to 
the oligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a spirit 
of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is restored.</P>
<P id=id03470>Yes, he said, that sometimes happens.</P>
<P id=id03471>And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh 
ones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father, does not 
know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.</P>
<P id=id03472>Yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.</P>
<P id=id03473>They draw him to his old associates, and holding secret 
intercourse with them, breed and multiply in him.</P>
<P id=id03474>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03475>At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, 
which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true 
words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods, and 
are their best guardians and sentinels.</P>
<P id=id03476>None better.</P>
<P id=id03477>False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take 
their place.</P>
<P id=id03478>They are certain to do so.</P>
<P id=id03479>And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, 
and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be sent 
by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain conceits shut 
the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither allow the embassy itself 
to enter, private if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged 
will they listen to them or receive them. There is a battle and they gain the 
day, and then modesty, which they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into 
exile by them, and temperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in 
the mire and cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly 
expenditure are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble of evil 
appetites, they drive them beyond the border.</P>
<P id=id03480>Yes, with a will.</P>
<P id=id03481>And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is 
now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries, the 
next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and 
impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and a great company 
with them, hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names; insolence they 
term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and waste magnificence, and impudence 
courage. And so the young man passes out of his original nature, which was 
trained in the school of necessity, into the freedom and libertinism of useless 
and unnecessary pleasures.</P>
<P id=id03482>Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.</P>
<P id=id03483>After this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on 
unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be 
fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have elapsed, 
and the heyday of passion is over—supposing that he then re-admits into the city 
some part of the exiled virtues, and does not wholly give himself up to their 
successors—in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of 
equilibrium, putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which 
comes first and wins the turn; and when he has had enough of that, then into the 
hands of another; he despises none of them but encourages them all equally.</P>
<P id=id03484>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03485>Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true 
word of advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions 
of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought to use 
and honour some and chastise and master the others—whenever this is repeated to 
him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike, and that one is as good 
as another.</P>
<P id=id03486>Yes, he said; that is the way with him.</P>
<P id=id03487>Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of 
the hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then he 
becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn at 
gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once more living 
the life of a philosopher; often he-is busy with politics, and starts to his 
feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if he is emulous of 
any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or of men of business, 
once more in that. His life has neither law nor order; and this distracted 
existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so he goes on.</P>
<P id=id03488>Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.</P>
<P id=id03489>Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the 
lives of many;—he answers to the State which we described as fair and spangled. 
And many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern, and many a 
constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him.</P>
<P id=id03490>Just so.</P>
<P id=id03491>Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called 
the democratic man.</P>
<P id=id03492>Let that be his place, he said.</P>
<P id=id03493>Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, 
tyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.</P>
<P id=id03494>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03495>Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise?—that it 
has a democratic origin is evident.</P>
<P id=id03496>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03497>And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as 
democracy from oligarchy—I mean, after a sort?</P>
<P id=id03498>How?</P>
<P id=id03499>The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which 
it was maintained was excess of wealth—am I not right?</P>
<P id=id03500>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03501>And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other 
things for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?</P>
<P id=id03502>True.</P>
<P id=id03503>And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire 
brings her to dissolution?</P>
<P id=id03504>What good?</P>
<P id=id03505>Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the 
glory of the State—and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of 
nature deign to dwell.</P>
<P id=id03506>Yes; the saying is in everybody's mouth.</P>
<P id=id03507>I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the 
neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions a 
demand for tyranny.</P>
<P id=id03508>How so?</P>
<P id=id03509>When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil 
cupbearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine 
of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful 
draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are 
cursed oligarchs.</P>
<P id=id03510>Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.</P>
<P id=id03511>Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her 
slaves who hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are 
like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her own 
heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, in such a 
State, can liberty have any limit?</P>
<P id=id03512>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id03513>By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends 
by getting among the animals and infecting them.</P>
<P id=id03514>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id03515>I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of 
his sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he having 
no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his freedom, and 
metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic, and the stranger 
is quite as good as either.</P>
<P id=id03516>Yes, he said, that is the way.</P>
<P id=id03517>And these are not the only evils, I said—there are several lesser 
ones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars, and 
the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are all alike; and 
the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready to compete with him in 
word or deed; and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and 
gaiety; they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative, and therefore they 
adopt the manners of the young.</P>
<P id=id03518>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03519>The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with 
money, whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor must 
I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to 
each other.</P>
<P id=id03520>Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our 
lips?</P>
<P id=id03521>That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who 
does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the animals 
who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other State: 
for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good as their 
she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all 
the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at anybody who comes in 
their way if he does not leave the road clear for them: and all things are just 
ready to burst with liberty.</P>
<P id=id03522>When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you 
describe. You and I have dreamed the same thing.</P>
<P id=id03523>And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive 
the citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and 
at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written or 
unwritten; they will have no one over them.</P>
<P id=id03524>Yes, he said, I know it too well.</P>
<P id=id03525>Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of 
which springs tyranny.</P>
<P id=id03526>Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step?</P>
<P id=id03527>The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease 
magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy—the truth being that 
the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite 
direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and 
animal life, but above all in forms of government.</P>
<P id=id03528>True.</P>
<P id=id03529>The excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems 
only to pass into excess of slavery.</P>
<P id=id03530>Yes, the natural order.</P>
<P id=id03531>And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most 
aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of 
liberty?</P>
<P id=id03532>As we might expect.</P>
<P id=id03533>That, however, was not, as I believe, your question-you rather 
desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and 
democracy, and is the ruin of both?</P>
<P id=id03534>Just so, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03535>Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, 
of whom the more courageous are the-leaders and the more timid the followers, 
the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless, and others having 
stings.</P>
<P id=id03536>A very just comparison.</P>
<P id=id03537>These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are 
generated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. And the good physician 
and lawgiver of the State ought, like the wise bee-master, to keep them at a 
distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in; and if they have anyhow 
found a way in, then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as 
possible.</P>
<P id=id03538>Yes, by all means, he said.</P>
<P id=id03539>Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us 
imagine democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for in the 
first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were 
in the oligarchical State.</P>
<P id=id03540>That is true.</P>
<P id=id03541>And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.</P>
<P id=id03542>How so?</P>
<P id=id03543>Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven 
from office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a 
democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener sort 
speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to 
be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost everything is managed by 
the drones.</P>
<P id=id03544>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03545>Then there is another class which is always being severed from the 
mass.</P>
<P id=id03546>What is that?</P>
<P id=id03547>They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders sure to 
be the richest.</P>
<P id=id03548>Naturally so.</P>
<P id=id03549>They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount 
of honey to the drones.</P>
<P id=id03550>Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who 
have little.</P>
<P id=id03551>And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon 
them.</P>
<P id=id03552>That is pretty much the case, he said.</P>
<P id=id03553>The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with 
their own hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon. This, 
when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy.</P>
<P id=id03554>True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to 
congregate unless they get a little honey.</P>
<P id=id03555>And do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the 
rich of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time 
taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?</P>
<P id=id03556>Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.</P>
<P id=id03557>And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to 
defend themselves before the people as they best can?</P>
<P id=id03558>What else can they do?</P>
<P id=id03559>And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others 
charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy? 
True.</P>
<P id=id03560>And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own 
accord, but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers, 
seeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in 
reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the drones torments them and 
breeds revolution in them.</P>
<P id=id03561>That is exactly the truth.</P>
<P id=id03562>Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one 
another.</P>
<P id=id03563>True.</P>
<P id=id03564>The people have always some champion whom they set over them and 
nurse into greatness.</P>
<P id=id03565>Yes, that is their way.</P>
<P id=id03566>This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he 
first appears above ground he is a protector.</P>
<P id=id03567>Yes, that is quite clear.</P>
<P id=id03568>How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly 
when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of 
Lycaean Zeus.</P>
<P id=id03569>What tale?</P>
<P id=id03570>The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human 
victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a 
wolf. Did you never hear it?</P>
<P id=id03571>Oh, yes.</P>
<P id=id03572>And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely 
at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the 
favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them, 
making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the 
blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills and others he banishes, at the same 
time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands: and after this, 
what will be his destiny? Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, 
or from being a man become a wolf—that is, a tyrant?</P>
<P id=id03573>Inevitably.</P>
<P id=id03574>This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the 
rich?</P>
<P id=id03575>The same.</P>
<P id=id03576>After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his 
enemies, a tyrant full grown.</P>
<P id=id03577>That is clear.</P>
<P id=id03578>And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to 
death by a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.</P>
<P id=id03579>Yes, he said, that is their usual way.</P>
<P id=id03580>Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device 
of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career—'Let not the 
people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'</P>
<P id=id03581>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id03582>The people readily assent; all their fears are for him—they have 
none for themselves.</P>
<P id=id03583>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03584>And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an 
enemy of the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to 
Croesus,</P>
<P id=id03585>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests 
not and is not<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed to be a coward.<BR></P>
<P id=id03586>And quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be 
ashamed again.</P>
<P id=id03587>But if he is caught he dies.</P>
<P id=id03588>Of course.</P>
<P id=id03589>And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 
'larding the plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing 
up in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector, but 
tyrant absolute.</P>
<P id=id03590>No doubt, he said.</P>
<P id=id03591>And now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the 
State in which a creature like him is generated.</P>
<P id=id03592>Yes, he said, let us consider that.</P>
<P id=id03593>At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, 
and he salutes every one whom he meets;—he to be called a tyrant, who is making 
promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and distributing 
land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so kind and good to 
every one!</P>
<P id=id03594>Of course, he said.</P>
<P id=id03595>But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, 
and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war 
or other, in order that the people may require a leader.</P>
<P id=id03596>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id03597>Has he not also another object, which is that they may be 
impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to 
their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him? 
Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03598>And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of 
freedom, and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for 
destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these 
reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.</P>
<P id=id03599>He must.</P>
<P id=id03600>Now he begins to grow unpopular.</P>
<P id=id03601>A necessary result.</P>
<P id=id03602>Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in 
power, speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of 
them cast in his teeth what is being done.</P>
<P id=id03603>Yes, that may be expected.</P>
<P id=id03604>And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he 
cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.</P>
<P id=id03605>He cannot.</P>
<P id=id03606>And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who 
is high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of them 
all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no, until he has 
made a purgation of the State.</P>
<P id=id03607>Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.</P>
<P id=id03608>Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make 
of the body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he does 
the reverse.</P>
<P id=id03609>If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.</P>
<P id=id03610>What a blessed alternative, I said:—to be compelled to dwell only 
with the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!</P>
<P id=id03611>Yes, that is the alternative.</P>
<P id=id03612>And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more 
satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?</P>
<P id=id03613>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03614>And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?</P>
<P id=id03615>They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if lie pays 
them.</P>
<P id=id03616>By the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from 
every land.</P>
<P id=id03617>Yes, he said, there are.</P>
<P id=id03618>But will he not desire to get them on the spot?</P>
<P id=id03619>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id03620>He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them 
free and enrol them in his bodyguard.</P>
<P id=id03621>To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of 
all.</P>
<P id=id03622>What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put 
to death the others and has these for his trusted friends.</P>
<P id=id03623>Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.</P>
<P id=id03624>Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called 
into existence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate and 
avoid him.</P>
<P id=id03625>Of course.</P>
<P id=id03626>Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great 
tragedian.</P>
<P id=id03627>Why so?</P>
<P id=id03628>Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,</P>
<P id=id03629>Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;</P>
<P id=id03630>and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant 
makes his companions.</P>
<P id=id03631>Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many 
other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.</P>
<P id=id03632>And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will 
forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them 
into our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.</P>
<P id=id03633>Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive 
us.</P>
<P id=id03634>But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and 
hire voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to tyrannies 
and democracies.</P>
<P id=id03635>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03636>Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour—the greatest 
honour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from 
democracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more their 
reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed 
further.</P>
<P id=id03637>True.</P>
<P id=id03638>But we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and 
enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and 
ever-changing army of his.</P>
<P id=id03639>If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will 
confiscate and spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons 
may suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have 
to impose upon the people.</P>
<P id=id03640>And when these fail?</P>
<P id=id03641>Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether 
male or female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.</P>
<P id=id03642>You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his 
being, will maintain him and his companions?</P>
<P id=id03643>Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.</P>
<P id=id03644>But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a 
grown-up son ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should 
be supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or settle him 
in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the 
servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and 
companions; but that his son should protect him, and that by his help he might 
be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic, as they are 
termed. And so he bids him and his companions depart, just as any other father 
might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates.</P>
<P id=id03645>By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster 
he has been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he will 
find that he is weak and his son strong.</P>
<P id=id03646>Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? 
What! beat his father if he opposes him?</P>
<P id=id03647>Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.</P>
<P id=id03648>Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; 
and this is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the 
saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of 
freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. Thus liberty, 
getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest and bitterest form 
of slavery.</P>
<P id=id03649>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id03650>Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently 
discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy 
to tyranny?</P>
<P id=id03651>Yes, quite enough, he said.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id03652>BOOK IX</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id03653>SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS</H4>
<P id=id03654>LAST of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more 
to ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in 
happiness or in misery?</P>
<P id=id03655>Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.</P>
<P id=id03656>There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains 
unanswered.</P>
<P id=id03657>What question?</P>
<P id=id03658>I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and 
number of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always 
be confused.</P>
<P id=id03659>Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.</P>
<P id=id03660>Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to 
understand: Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be 
unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are 
controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over 
them-either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak; while in the 
case of others they are stronger, and there are more of them.</P>
<P id=id03661>Which appetites do you mean?</P>
<P id=id03662>I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and 
ruling power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or 
drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires; 
and there is no conceivable folly or crime—not excepting incest or any other 
unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food—which at such a 
time, when he has parted company with all shame and sense, a man may not be 
ready to commit.</P>
<P id=id03663>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03664>But when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before 
going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble 
thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having first 
indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just enough to lay 
them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering 
with the higher principle—which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction, 
free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, 
present, or future: when again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has 
a quarrel against any one—I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational 
principles, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, 
then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least likely to be the 
sport of fantastic and lawless visions.</P>
<P id=id03665>I quite agree.</P>
<P id=id03666>In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the 
point which I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is a 
lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider whether I am 
right, and you agree with me.</P>
<P id=id03667>Yes, I agree.</P>
<P id=id03668>And now remember the character which we attributed to the 
democratic man. He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained 
under a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but 
discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?</P>
<P id=id03669>True.</P>
<P id=id03670>And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious 
sort of people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite 
extreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. At last, being a better man 
than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and 
led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but of what he deemed moderate 
indulgence in various pleasures. After this manner the democrat was generated 
out of the oligarch?</P>
<P id=id03671>Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.</P>
<P id=id03672>And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must 
conceive this man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his 
father's principles.</P>
<P id=id03673>I can imagine him.</P>
<P id=id03674>Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son 
which has already happened to the father:—he is drawn into a perfectly lawless 
life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his father and 
friends take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite party assist the 
opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and tyrant-makers find that they 
are losing their hold on him, they contrive to implant in him a master passion, 
to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts—a sort of monstrous winged 
drone—that is the only image which will adequately describe him.</P>
<P id=id03675>Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.</P>
<P id=id03676>And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and 
garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let loose, 
come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they 
implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this lord of the soul, having 
Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks out into a frenzy: and if he finds 
in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation, and there is 
in him any sense of shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, 
and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness 
to the full.</P>
<P id=id03677>Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is 
generated.</P>
<P id=id03678>And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a 
tyrant?</P>
<P id=id03679>I should not wonder.</P>
<P id=id03680>Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a 
tyrant?</P>
<P id=id03681>He has.</P>
<P id=id03682>And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, 
will fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the 
gods?</P>
<P id=id03683>That he will.</P>
<P id=id03684>And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into 
being when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes 
drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so?</P>
<P id=id03685>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id03686>Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he 
live?</P>
<P id=id03687>Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.</P>
<P id=id03688>I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there 
will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort of 
thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the concerns of 
his soul.</P>
<P id=id03689>That is certain.</P>
<P id=id03690>Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and 
formidable, and their demands are many.</P>
<P id=id03691>They are indeed, he said.</P>
<P id=id03692>His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.</P>
<P id=id03693>True.</P>
<P id=id03694>Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.</P>
<P id=id03695>Of course.</P>
<P id=id03696>When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the 
nest like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them, and 
especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them, is in a 
frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property, 
in order that he may gratify them?</P>
<P id=id03697>Yes, that is sure to be the case.</P>
<P id=id03698>He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains 
and pangs.</P>
<P id=id03699>He must.</P>
<P id=id03700>And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new 
got the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger will 
claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has spent his own 
share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.</P>
<P id=id03701>No doubt he will.</P>
<P id=id03702>And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of 
all to cheat and deceive them.</P>
<P id=id03703>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03704>And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.</P>
<P id=id03705>Yes, probably.</P>
<P id=id03706>And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my 
friend?<BR>Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over 
them?<BR></P>
<P id=id03707>Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his 
parents.</P>
<P id=id03708>But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love of 
a harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe that he 
would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very 
existence, and would place her under the authority of the other, when she is 
brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like circumstances, he 
would do the same to his withered old father, first and most indispensable of 
friends, for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of 
indispensable?</P>
<P id=id03709>Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.</P>
<P id=id03710>Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father 
and mother.</P>
<P id=id03711>He is indeed, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03712>He first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures 
are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house, or 
steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to clear a 
temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child, and which gave 
judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those others which have just 
been emancipated, and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire. These 
in his democratic days, when he was still subject to the laws and to his father, 
were only let loose in the dreams of sleep. But now that he is under the 
dominion of love, he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very 
rarely and in a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden 
food, or be guilty of any other horrid act. Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly 
in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads 
a State, to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain 
himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications 
have brought in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break 
loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we not here 
a picture of his way of life?</P>
<P id=id03713>Yes, indeed, he said.</P>
<P id=id03714>And if there are only a few of them in the State, the rest of the 
people are well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary 
soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war; and if there 
is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the 
city.</P>
<P id=id03715>What sort of mischief?</P>
<P id=id03716>For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads, 
robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak 
they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.</P>
<P id=id03717>A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are 
few in number.</P>
<P id=id03718>Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all 
these things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not 
come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and their 
followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength, assisted by the 
infatuation of the people, they choose from among themselves the one who has 
most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him they create their tyrant.</P>
<P id=id03719>Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.</P>
<P id=id03720>If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he 
began by beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he 
beats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the Cretans 
say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their 
rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and desires.</P>
<P id=id03721>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id03722>When such men are only private individuals and before they get 
power, this is their character; they associate entirely with their own 
flatterers or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their 
turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every sort of 
affection for them; but when they have gained their point they know them no 
more.</P>
<P id=id03723>Yes, truly.</P>
<P id=id03724>They are always either the masters or servants and never the 
friends of anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.</P>
<P id=id03725>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id03726>And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?</P>
<P id=id03727>No question.</P>
<P id=id03728>Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of 
justice?</P>
<P id=id03729>Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.</P>
<P id=id03730>Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst 
man: he is the waking reality of what we dreamed.</P>
<P id=id03731>Most true.</P>
<P id=id03732>And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, 
and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.</P>
<H5 id=id03733>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H5>
<P id=id03734>That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.</P>
<P id=id03735>And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also 
the most miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually 
and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in general?</P>
<P id=id03736>Yes, he said, inevitably.</P>
<P id=id03737>And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and 
the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the 
others?</P>
<P id=id03738>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03739>And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in 
relation to man?</P>
<P id=id03740>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id03741>Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the 
city which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?</P>
<P id=id03742>They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best 
and the other is the very worst.</P>
<P id=id03743>There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and 
therefore I will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision 
about their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow ourselves 
to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is only a unit and may 
perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us go as we ought into every 
corner of the city and look all about, and then we will give our opinion.</P>
<P id=id03744>A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that 
a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king the 
happiest.</P>
<P id=id03745>And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like 
request, that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through 
human nature? He must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is 
dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the 
beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose that the 
judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge, and has 
dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at his dally life and known 
him in his family relations, where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy 
attire, and again in the hour of public danger—he shall tell us about the 
happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men?</P>
<P id=id03746>That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.</P>
<P id=id03747>Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges 
and have before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who will 
answer our enquiries.</P>
<P id=id03748>By all means.</P>
<P id=id03749>Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and 
the State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other of 
them, will you tell me their respective conditions?</P>
<P id=id03750>What do you mean? he asked.</P>
<P id=id03751>Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city 
which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?</P>
<P id=id03752>No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.</P>
<P id=id03753>And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such 
a<BR>State?<BR></P>
<P id=id03754>Yes, he said, I see that there are—a few; but the people, speaking 
generally, and the best of them, are miserably degraded and enslaved.</P>
<P id=id03755>Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule 
prevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity—the best elements in him are 
enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the worst and 
maddest.</P>
<P id=id03756>Inevitably.</P>
<P id=id03757>And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a 
freeman, or of a slave?</P>
<P id=id03758>He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.</P>
<P id=id03759>And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly 
incapable of acting voluntarily?</P>
<P id=id03760>Utterly incapable.</P>
<P id=id03761>And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the 
soul taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a 
gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?</P>
<P id=id03762>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03763>And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?</P>
<P id=id03764>Poor.</P>
<P id=id03765>And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?</P>
<P id=id03766>True.</P>
<P id=id03767>And must not such a State and such a man be always full of 
fear?</P>
<P id=id03768>Yes, indeed.</P>
<P id=id03769>Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and 
sorrow and groaning and pain?</P>
<P id=id03770>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id03771>And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of 
misery than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?</P>
<P id=id03772>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id03773>Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical 
State to be the most miserable of States?</P>
<P id=id03774>And I was right, he said.</P>
<P id=id03775>Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the 
tyrannical man, what do you say of him?</P>
<P id=id03776>I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.</P>
<P id=id03777>There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.</P>
<P id=id03778>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id03779>I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of 
misery.</P>
<P id=id03780>Then who is more miserable?</P>
<P id=id03781>One of whom I am about to speak.</P>
<P id=id03782>Who is that?</P>
<P id=id03783>He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private 
life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.</P>
<P id=id03784>From what has been said, I gather that you are right.</P>
<P id=id03785>Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little 
more certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this 
respecting good and evil is the greatest.</P>
<P id=id03786>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03787>Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a 
light upon this subject.</P>
<P id=id03788>What is your illustration?</P>
<P id=id03789>The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: 
from them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have 
slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.</P>
<P id=id03790>Yes, that is the difference.</P>
<P id=id03791>You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend 
from their servants?</P>
<P id=id03792>What should they fear?</P>
<P id=id03793>Nothing. But do you observe the reason of this?</P>
<P id=id03794>Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for 
the protection of each individual.</P>
<P id=id03795>Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say 
of some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, carried 
off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him—will he 
not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to 
death by his slaves?</P>
<P id=id03796>Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.</P>
<P id=id03797>The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers 
of his slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things, much 
against his will—he will have to cajole his own servants.</P>
<P id=id03798>Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.</P>
<P id=id03799>And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him 
with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and 
who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?</P>
<P id=id03800>His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere 
surrounded and watched by enemies.</P>
<P id=id03801>And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be 
bound—he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of 
fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all men in the 
city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see the things which other 
freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the 
house, and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees 
anything of interest.</P>
<P id=id03802>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03803>And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in 
his own person—the tyrannical man, I mean—whom you just now decided to be the 
most miserable of all—will not he be yet more miserable when, instead of leading 
a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant? He has to be 
master of others when he is not master of himself: he is like a diseased or 
paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life, not in retirement, but fighting 
and combating with other men.</P>
<P id=id03804>Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.</P>
<P id=id03805>Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant 
lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?</P>
<P id=id03806>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03807>He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real 
slave, and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to 
be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is utterly 
unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor, if you 
know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he is beset with 
fear and is full of convulsions, and distractions, even as the State which he 
resembles: and surely the resemblance holds?</P>
<P id=id03808>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03809>Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having 
power: he becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust, 
more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor and 
cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is supremely 
miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself.</P>
<P id=id03810>No man of any sense will dispute your words.</P>
<P id=id03811>Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical 
contests proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first 
in the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others follow: 
there are five of them in all—they are the royal, timocratical, oligarchical, 
democratical, tyrannical.</P>
<P id=id03812>The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be 
choruses coming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they 
enter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.</P>
<P id=id03813>Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of 
Ariston (the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest, 
and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and that 
the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that this is he 
who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his 
State?</P>
<P id=id03814>Make the proclamation yourself, he said.</P>
<P id=id03815>And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?</P>
<P id=id03816>Let the words be added.</P>
<P id=id03817>Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, 
which may also have some weight.</P>
<P id=id03818>What is that?</P>
<P id=id03819>The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing 
that the individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three 
principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.</P>
<P id=id03820>Of what nature?</P>
<P id=id03821>It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures 
correspond; also three desires and governing powers.</P>
<P id=id03822>How do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id03823>There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man 
learns, another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no 
special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the 
extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and 
the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it; also 
money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of 
money.</P>
<P id=id03824>That is true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03825>If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part 
were concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single 
notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as 
loving gain or money.</P>
<P id=id03826>I agree with you.</P>
<P id=id03827>Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and 
conquering and getting fame?</P>
<P id=id03828>True.</P>
<P id=id03829>Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious—would the term be 
suitable?</P>
<P id=id03830>Extremely suitable.</P>
<P id=id03831>On the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge 
is wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others for 
gain or fame.</P>
<P id=id03832>Far less.</P>
<P id=id03833>'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may 
fitly apply to that part of the soul?</P>
<P id=id03834>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03835>One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another 
in others, as may happen?</P>
<P id=id03836>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03837>Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of 
men—lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?</P>
<P id=id03838>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id03839>And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several 
objects?</P>
<P id=id03840>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03841>Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in 
turn which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own 
and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity of 
honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold 
and silver?</P>
<P id=id03842>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id03843>And the lover of honour—what will be his opinion? Will he not 
think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if 
it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?</P>
<P id=id03844>Very true.</P>
<P id=id03845>And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value 
on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, and in 
that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the heaven of 
pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if 
there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?</P>
<P id=id03846>There can be no doubt of that, he replied.</P>
<P id=id03847>Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are 
in dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable, or 
better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless—how shall we know 
who speaks truly?</P>
<P id=id03848>I cannot myself tell, he said.</P>
<P id=id03849>Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than 
experience and wisdom and reason?</P>
<P id=id03850>There cannot be a better, he said.</P>
<P id=id03851>Then, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the 
greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of 
gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the 
pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain?</P>
<P id=id03852>The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has 
of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood 
upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity 
tasted—or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could hardly have 
tasted—the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.</P>
<P id=id03853>Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of 
gain, for he has a double experience?</P>
<P id=id03854>Yes, very great.</P>
<P id=id03855>Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or 
the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?</P>
<P id=id03856>Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain 
their object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have 
their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have experience 
of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be found in the 
knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.</P>
<P id=id03857>His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any 
one?</P>
<P id=id03858>Far better.</P>
<P id=id03859>And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?</P>
<P id=id03860>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03861>Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is 
not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?</P>
<P id=id03862>What faculty?</P>
<P id=id03863>Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to 
rest.</P>
<P id=id03864>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03865>And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?</P>
<P id=id03866>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03867>If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of 
the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?</P>
<P id=id03868>Assuredly.</P>
<P id=id03869>Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of 
the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?</P>
<P id=id03870>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03871>But since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges—</P>
<P id=id03872>The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which 
are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.</P>
<P id=id03873>And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the 
intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us 
in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.</P>
<P id=id03874>Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when 
he approves of his own life.</P>
<P id=id03875>And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and 
the pleasure which is next?</P>
<P id=id03876>Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to 
himself than the money-maker.</P>
<P id=id03877>Last comes the lover of gain?</P>
<P id=id03878>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03879>Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust 
in this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian 
Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the 
wise is quite true and pure—all others are a shadow only; and surely this will 
prove the greatest and most decisive of falls?</P>
<P id=id03880>Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?</P>
<P id=id03881>I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.</P>
<P id=id03882>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id03883>Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?</P>
<P id=id03884>True.</P>
<P id=id03885>And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor 
pain?</P>
<P id=id03886>There is.</P>
<P id=id03887>A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul 
about either—that is what you mean?</P>
<P id=id03888>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03889>You remember what people say when they are sick?</P>
<P id=id03890>What do they say?</P>
<P id=id03891>That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they 
never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.</P>
<P id=id03892>Yes, I know, he said.</P>
<P id=id03893>And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must. have 
heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their 
pain?</P>
<P id=id03894>I have.</P>
<P id=id03895>And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest 
and cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them as 
the greatest pleasure?</P>
<P id=id03896>Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be 
at rest.</P>
<P id=id03897>Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will 
be painful?</P>
<P id=id03898>Doubtless, he said.</P>
<P id=id03899>Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also 
be pain?</P>
<P id=id03900>So it would seem.</P>
<P id=id03901>But can that which is neither become both?</P>
<P id=id03902>I should say not.</P>
<P id=id03903>And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they 
not?</P>
<P id=id03904>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03905>But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not 
motion, and in a mean between them?</P>
<P id=id03906>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03907>How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain 
is pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?</P>
<P id=id03908>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id03909>This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, 
the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful, and 
painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations, when 
tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of imposition?</P>
<P id=id03910>That is the inference.</P>
<P id=id03911>Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent 
pains and you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that 
pleasure is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.</P>
<P id=id03912>What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?</P>
<P id=id03913>There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures, of 
smell, which are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, 
and when they depart leave no pain behind them.</P>
<P id=id03914>Most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id03915>Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the 
cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.</P>
<P id=id03916>No.</P>
<P id=id03917>Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the 
soul through the body are generally of this sort—they are reliefs of pain.</P>
<P id=id03918>That is true.</P>
<P id=id03919>And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like 
nature?</P>
<P id=id03920>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03921>Shall I give you an illustration of them?</P>
<P id=id03922>Let me hear.</P>
<P id=id03923>You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and 
lower and middle region?</P>
<P id=id03924>I should.</P>
<P id=id03925>And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, 
would he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle 
and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper 
region, if he has never seen the true upper world?</P>
<P id=id03926>To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?</P>
<P id=id03927>But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly 
imagine, that he was descending?</P>
<P id=id03928>No doubt.</P>
<P id=id03929>All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and 
middle and lower regions?</P>
<P id=id03930>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03931>Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the 
truth, as they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong 
ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when they are 
only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which 
they experience to be real, and in like manner, when drawn away from pain to the 
neutral or intermediate state, they firmly believe that they have reached the 
goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting 
pain with the absence of pain, which is like contrasting black with grey instead 
of white—can you wonder, I say, at this?</P>
<P id=id03932>No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the 
opposite.</P>
<P id=id03933>Look at the matter thus:—Hunger, thirst, and the like, are 
inanitions of the bodily state?</P>
<P id=id03934>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03935>And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?</P>
<P id=id03936>True.</P>
<P id=id03937>And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of 
either?</P>
<P id=id03938>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03939>And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from 
that which has more existence the truer?</P>
<P id=id03940>Clearly, from that which has more.</P>
<P id=id03941>What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in 
your judgment—those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of 
sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge 
and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put the question in this 
way:—Which has a more pure being—that which is concerned with the invariable, 
the immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such 
natures; or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal, 
and is itself variable and mortal?</P>
<P id=id03942>Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned 
with the invariable.</P>
<P id=id03943>And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the 
same degree as of essence?</P>
<P id=id03944>Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.</P>
<P id=id03945>And of truth in the same degree?</P>
<P id=id03946>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03947>And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less 
of essence?</P>
<P id=id03948>Necessarily.</P>
<P id=id03949>Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service 
of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service 
of the soul?</P>
<P id=id03950>Far less.</P>
<P id=id03951>And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the 
soul?</P>
<P id=id03952>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03953>What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more 
real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real 
existence and is less real?</P>
<P id=id03954>Of course.</P>
<P id=id03955>And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is 
according to nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will 
more really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates in 
less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will participate in 
an illusory and less real pleasure?</P>
<P id=id03956>Unquestionably.</P>
<P id=id03957>Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy 
with gluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and in 
this region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass into the 
true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever find their way, 
neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do they taste of pure and 
abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes always looking down and their 
heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the dining-table, they fatten and feed 
and breed, and, in their excessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at 
one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one 
another by reason of their insatiable lust. For they fill themselves with that 
which is not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is also 
unsubstantial and incontinent.</P>
<P id=id03958>Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many 
like an oracle.</P>
<P id=id03959>Their pleasures are mixed with pains—how can they be otherwise? 
For they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by 
contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in the 
minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about as 
Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at Troy in 
ignorance of the truth.</P>
<P id=id03960>Something of that sort must inevitably happen.</P>
<P id=id03961>And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate 
element of the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into 
action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and 
contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour and 
victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense?</P>
<P id=id03962>Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element 
also.</P>
<P id=id03963>Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and 
honour, when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of 
reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows 
them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is 
attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and they will have the 
pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is best for each one is also 
most natural to him?</P>
<P id=id03964>Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.</P>
<P id=id03965>And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and 
there is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own 
business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are 
capable?</P>
<P id=id03966>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id03967>But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in 
attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure 
which is a shadow only and which is not their own?</P>
<P id=id03968>True.</P>
<P id=id03969>And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy 
and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?</P>
<P id=id03970>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03971>And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest 
distance from law and order?</P>
<P id=id03972>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id03973>And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the 
greatest distance? Yes.</P>
<P id=id03974>And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?</P>
<P id=id03975>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03976>Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or 
natural pleasure, and the king at the least?</P>
<P id=id03977>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03978>But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king 
most pleasantly?</P>
<P id=id03979>Inevitably.</P>
<P id=id03980>Would you know the measure of the interval which separates 
them?</P>
<P id=id03981>Will you tell me?</P>
<P id=id03982>There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: 
now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he has 
run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode with certain 
slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure of his inferiority can 
only be expressed in a figure.</P>
<P id=id03983>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id03984>I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the 
oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?</P>
<P id=id03985>Yes.</P>
<P id=id03986>And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to 
an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of 
the oligarch?</P>
<P id=id03987>He will.</P>
<P id=id03988>And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one 
royal and aristocratical?</P>
<P id=id03989>Yes, he is third.</P>
<P id=id03990>Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a 
number which is three times three?</P>
<P id=id03991>Manifestly.</P>
<P id=id03992>The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of 
length will be a plane figure.</P>
<P id=id03993>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id03994>And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no 
difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from 
the king.</P>
<P id=id03995>Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.</P>
<P id=id03996>Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the 
interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he 
will find him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729 times more 
pleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.</P>
<P id=id03997>What a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the distance 
which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!</P>
<P id=id03998>Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns 
human life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and 
years.</P>
<P id=id03999>Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.</P>
<P id=id04000>Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the 
evil and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life 
and in beauty and virtue?</P>
<P id=id04001>Immeasurably greater.</P>
<P id=id04002>Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the 
argument, we may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one 
saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be 
just?</P>
<P id=id04003>Yes, that was said.</P>
<P id=id04004>Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and 
injustice, let us have a little conversation with him.</P>
<P id=id04005>What shall we say to him?</P>
<P id=id04006>Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words 
presented before his eyes.</P>
<P id=id04007>Of what sort?</P>
<P id=id04008>An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of 
ancient mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many 
others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.</P>
<P id=id04009>There are said of have been such unions.</P>
<P id=id04010>Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed 
monster, having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he 
is able to generate and metamorphose at will.</P>
<P id=id04011>You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is 
more pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as you 
propose.</P>
<P id=id04012>Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third 
of a man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the 
second.</P>
<P id=id04013>That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you 
say.</P>
<P id=id04014>And now join them, and let the three grow into one.</P>
<P id=id04015>That has been accomplished.</P>
<P id=id04016>Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, 
so that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull, may 
believe the beast to be a single human creature. I have done so, he said.</P>
<P id=id04017>And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human 
creature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that, if he be 
right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and 
strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to starve and weaken the 
man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of 
the other two; and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with 
one another—he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one 
another.</P>
<P id=id04018>Certainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice 
says.</P>
<P id=id04019>To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever 
so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most 
complete mastery over the entire human creature.</P>
<P id=id04020>He should watch over the many-headed monster like a good 
husbandman, fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the 
wild ones from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in 
common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and 
with himself.</P>
<P id=id04021>Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice 
say.</P>
<P id=id04022>And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or 
advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the 
disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant.</P>
<P id=id04023>Yes, from every point of view.</P>
<P id=id04024>Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not 
intentionally in error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think you of 
things esteemed noble and ignoble? Is not the noble that which subjects the 
beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which 
subjects the man to the beast?' He can hardly avoid saying yes—can he now?</P>
<P id=id04025>Not if he has any regard for my opinion.</P>
<P id=id04026>But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another 
question: 'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the 
condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst? Who can 
imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, 
especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the 
gainer, however large might be the sum which he received? And will any one say 
that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being 
to that which is most godless and detestable? Eriphyle took the necklace as the 
price of her husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a 
worse ruin.'</P>
<P id=id04027>Yes, said Glaucon, far worse—I will answer for him.</P>
<P id=id04028>Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the 
huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?</P>
<P id=id04029>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id04030>And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and 
serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?</P>
<P id=id04031>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04032>And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken 
this same creature, and make a coward of him?</P>
<P id=id04033>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04034>And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who 
subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of 
money, of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his 
youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a monkey?</P>
<P id=id04035>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id04036>And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only 
because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is 
unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and his great 
study is how to flatter them.</P>
<P id=id04037>Such appears to be the reason.</P>
<P id=id04038>And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like 
that of the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom 
the Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the servant, 
but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him; 
or, if this be impossible, then by an external authority, in order that we may 
be all, as far as possible, under the same government, friends and equals.</P>
<P id=id04039>True, he said.</P>
<P id=id04040>And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is 
the ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we exercise 
over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in 
them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state, and by cultivation of 
this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our 
own, and when this is done they may go their ways.</P>
<P id=id04041>Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.</P>
<P id=id04042>From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that 
a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will 
make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his 
wickedness?</P>
<P id=id04043>From no point of view at all.</P>
<P id=id04044>What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and 
unpunished? He who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and 
punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the gentler 
element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the 
acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more than the body ever is by 
receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health, in proportion as the soul is 
more honourable than the body.</P>
<P id=id04045>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id04046>To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the 
energies of his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which 
impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?</P>
<P id=id04047>Clearly, he said.</P>
<P id=id04048>In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, 
and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that he 
will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object will be 
not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely thereby to gain 
temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the 
harmony of the soul?</P>
<P id=id04049>Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.</P>
<P id=id04050>And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and 
harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by 
the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite 
harm?</P>
<P id=id04051>Certainly not, he said.</P>
<P id=id04052>He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that 
no disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from 
want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend 
according to his means.</P>
<P id=id04053>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04054>And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such 
honours as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private 
or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?</P>
<P id=id04055>Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.</P>
<P id=id04056>By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he 
certainly will, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a 
divine call.</P>
<P id=id04057>I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of 
which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe 
that there is such an one anywhere on earth?</P>
<P id=id04058>In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, 
which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order. 
But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter; for he 
will live after the manner of that city, having nothing to do with any 
other.</P>
<P id=id04059>I think so, he said.</P>
<H2 style="MARGIN-TOP: 4em" id=id04060>BOOK X</H2>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id04061>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</H4>
<P id=id04062>OF THE many excellences which I perceive in the order of our 
State, there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about 
poetry.</P>
<P id=id04063>To what do you refer?</P>
<P id=id04064>To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to 
be received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been 
distinguished.</P>
<P id=id04065>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id04066>Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words 
repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe—but I do not mind 
saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of 
the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to 
them.</P>
<P id=id04067>Explain the purport of your remark.</P>
<P id=id04068>Well, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest 
youth had an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on my 
lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming 
tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth, and 
therefore I will speak out.</P>
<P id=id04069>Very good, he said.</P>
<P id=id04070>Listen to me then, or rather, answer me.</P>
<P id=id04071>Put your question.</P>
<P id=id04072>Can you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.</P>
<P id=id04073>A likely thing, then, that I should know.</P>
<P id=id04074>Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the 
keener.</P>
<P id=id04075>Very true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint 
notion, I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire yourself?</P>
<P id=id04076>Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: 
Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also 
a corresponding idea or form. Do you understand me?</P>
<P id=id04077>I do.</P>
<P id=id04078>Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the 
world—plenty of them, are there not?</P>
<P id=id04079>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04080>But there are only two ideas or forms of them—one the idea of a 
bed, the other of a table.</P>
<P id=id04081>True.</P>
<P id=id04082>And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table 
for our use, in accordance with the idea—that is our way of speaking in this and 
similar instances—but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how could he?</P>
<P id=id04083>Impossible.</P>
<P id=id04084>And there is another artist,—I should like to know what you would 
say of him.</P>
<P id=id04085>Who is he?</P>
<P id=id04086>One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.</P>
<P id=id04087>What an extraordinary man!</P>
<P id=id04088>Wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. 
For this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants 
and animals, himself and all other things—the earth and heaven, and the things 
which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods also.</P>
<P id=id04089>He must be a wizard and no mistake.</P>
<P id=id04090>Oh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no 
such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these 
things but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in which you could 
make them all yourself?</P>
<P id=id04091>What way?</P>
<P id=id04092>An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the 
feat might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of turning 
a mirror round and round—you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens, and 
the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants, and all the other things 
of which we were just now speaking, in the mirror.</P>
<P id=id04093>Yes, he said; but they would be appearances only.</P>
<P id=id04094>Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the 
painter too is, as I conceive, just such another—a creator of appearances, is he 
not?</P>
<P id=id04095>Of course.</P>
<P id=id04096>But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. 
And yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?</P>
<P id=id04097>Yes, he said, but not a real bed.</P>
<P id=id04098>And what of the maker of the bed? Were you not saying that he too 
makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but 
only a particular bed?</P>
<P id=id04099>Yes, I did.</P>
<P id=id04100>Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true 
existence, but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that 
the work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real existence, 
he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.</P>
<P id=id04101>At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not 
speaking the truth.</P>
<P id=id04102>No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of 
truth.</P>
<P id=id04103>No wonder.</P>
<P id=id04104>Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we 
enquire who this imitator is?</P>
<P id=id04105>If you please.</P>
<P id=id04106>Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is 
made by God, as I think that we may say—for no one else can be the maker?</P>
<P id=id04107>No.</P>
<P id=id04108>There is another which is the work of the carpenter?</P>
<P id=id04109>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04110>And the work of the painter is a third?</P>
<P id=id04111>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04112>Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who 
superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?</P>
<P id=id04113>Yes, there are three of them.</P>
<P id=id04114>God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature 
and one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will 
be made by God.</P>
<P id=id04115>Why is that?</P>
<P id=id04116>Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear 
behind them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the 
ideal bed and the two others.</P>
<P id=id04117>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id04118>God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, 
not a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed which 
is essentially and by nature one only.</P>
<P id=id04119>So we believe.</P>
<P id=id04120>Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the 
bed?</P>
<P id=id04121>Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He 
is the author of this and of all other things.</P>
<P id=id04122>And what shall we say of the carpenter—is not he also the maker of 
the bed?</P>
<P id=id04123>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04124>But would you call the painter a creator and maker?</P>
<P id=id04125>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id04126>Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?</P>
<P id=id04127>I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator 
of that which the others make.</P>
<P id=id04128>Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from 
nature an imitator?</P>
<P id=id04129>Certainly, he said.</P>
<P id=id04130>And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other 
imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?</P>
<P id=id04131>That appears to be so.</P>
<P id=id04132>Then about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the 
painter?— I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which 
originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?</P>
<P id=id04133>The latter.</P>
<P id=id04134>As they are or as they appear? You have still to determine 
this.</P>
<P id=id04135>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id04136>I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view, 
obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will appear 
different, but there is no difference in reality. And the same of all 
things.</P>
<P id=id04137>Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.</P>
<P id=id04138>Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting 
designed to be—an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear—of 
appearance or of reality?</P>
<P id=id04139>Of appearance.</P>
<P id=id04140>Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do 
all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part an 
image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any other 
artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is a good artist, he 
may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows them his picture of a 
carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that they are looking at a real 
carpenter.</P>
<P id=id04141>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04142>And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all 
the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a 
higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that 
we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived 
by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he 
himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and 
imitation.</P>
<P id=id04143>Most true.</P>
<P id=id04144>And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and 
Homer, who is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as 
well as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose well 
unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge can never be 
a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar 
illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them; 
they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but 
imitations thrice removed from the truth, and could easily be made without any 
knowledge of the truth, because they are appearances only and not realities? Or, 
after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about 
which they seem to the many to speak so well?</P>
<P id=id04145>The question, he said, should by all means be considered.</P>
<P id=id04146>Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original 
as well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making 
branch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if 
he had nothing higher in him?</P>
<P id=id04147>I should say not.</P>
<P id=id04148>The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be 
interested in realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as 
memorials of himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of 
encomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.</P>
<P id=id04149>Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour 
and profit.</P>
<P id=id04150>Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine, 
or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not going 
to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like Asclepius, or 
left behind him a school of medicine such as the Asclepiads were, or whether he 
only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand; but we have a right to 
know respecting military tactics, politics, education, which are the chiefest 
and noblest subjects of his poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. 'Friend 
Homer,' then we say to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from truth in 
what you say of virtue, and not in the third—not an image maker or imitator—and 
if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or 
public life, tell us what State was ever better governed by your help? The good 
order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and small 
have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have been a good 
legislator to them and have done them any good? Italy and Sicily boast of 
Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what city has 
anything to say about you?' Is there any city which he might name?</P>
<P id=id04151>I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves 
pretend that he was a legislator.</P>
<P id=id04152>Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on 
successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?</P>
<P id=id04153>There is not.</P>
<P id=id04154>Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to 
human life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other 
ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?</P>
<P id=id04155>There is absolutely nothing of the kind.</P>
<P id=id04156>But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a 
guide or teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate 
with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such as was 
established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, and whose 
followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after 
him?</P>
<P id=id04157>Nothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates, 
Creophylus, the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes 
us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as is said, 
Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was 
alive?</P>
<P id=id04158>Yes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, 
Glaucon, that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind—if he 
had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator—can you imagine, I say, 
that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and loved by them? 
Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of others, have only to 
whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be able to manage either your 
own house or your own State until you appoint us to be your ministers of 
education'—and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them 
love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders. And 
is it conceivable that the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would 
have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been 
able to make mankind virtuous? Would they not have been as unwilling to part 
with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them? Or, 
if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about 
everywhere, until they had got education enough?</P>
<P id=id04159>Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.</P>
<P id=id04160>Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, 
beginning with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the 
like, but the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as we have 
already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands 
nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know no more 
than he does, and judge only by colours and figures.</P>
<P id=id04161>Quite so.</P>
<P id=id04162>In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to 
lay on the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature only 
enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he is, and 
judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling, or of military 
tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony and rhythm, he speaks very 
well—such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have. And I 
think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the 
tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them, and 
recited in simple prose.</P>
<P id=id04163>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id04164>They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only 
blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?</P>
<P id=id04165>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id04166>Here is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows 
nothing of true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not right?</P>
<P id=id04167>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04168>Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with 
half an explanation.</P>
<P id=id04169>Proceed.</P>
<P id=id04170>Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint 
a bit?</P>
<P id=id04171>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04172>And the worker in leather and brass will make them?</P>
<P id=id04173>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04174>But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? 
Nay, hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the 
horseman who knows how to use them—he knows their right form.</P>
<P id=id04175>Most true.</P>
<P id=id04176>And may we not say the same of all things?</P>
<P id=id04177>What?</P>
<P id=id04178>That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one 
which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?</P>
<P id=id04179>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04180>And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate 
or inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which 
nature or the artist has intended them.</P>
<P id=id04181>True.</P>
<P id=id04182>Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, 
and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop 
themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker which 
of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell him how he ought to 
make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?</P>
<P id=id04183>Of course.</P>
<P id=id04184>The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the 
goodness and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what 
he is told by him?</P>
<P id=id04185>True.</P>
<P id=id04186>The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of 
it the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain from 
him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say, 
whereas the user will have knowledge?</P>
<P id=id04187>True.</P>
<P id=id04188>But will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether 
or no his drawing is correct or beautiful? Or will he have right opinion from 
being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions 
about what he should draw?</P>
<P id=id04189>Neither.</P>
<P id=id04190>Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge 
about the goodness or badness of his imitations?</P>
<P id=id04191>I suppose not.</P>
<P id=id04192>The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence 
about his own creations?</P>
<P id=id04193>Nay, very much the reverse.</P>
<P id=id04194>And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a 
thing good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which 
appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?</P>
<P id=id04195>Just so.</P>
<P id=id04196>Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no 
knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind of play 
or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic or in Heroic verse, 
are imitators in the highest degree?</P>
<P id=id04197>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04198>And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us 
to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?</P>
<P id=id04199>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04200>And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is 
addressed?</P>
<P id=id04201>What do you mean?</P>
<P id=id04202>I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears 
small when seen at a distance?</P>
<P id=id04203>True.</P>
<P id=id04204>And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the 
water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to 
the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of 
confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on 
which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other 
ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic.</P>
<P id=id04205>True.</P>
<P id=id04206>And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the 
rescue of the human understanding-there is the beauty of them—and the apparent 
greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, but 
give way before calculation and measure and weight?</P>
<P id=id04207>Most true.</P>
<P id=id04208>And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational 
principle in the soul</P>
<P id=id04209>To be sure.</P>
<P id=id04210>And when this principle measures and certifies that some things 
are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an 
apparent contradiction?</P>
<P id=id04211>True.</P>
<P id=id04212>But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same 
faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?</P>
<P id=id04213>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04214>Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to 
measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with 
measure?</P>
<P id=id04215>True.</P>
<P id=id04216>And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts 
to measure and calculation?</P>
<P id=id04217>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04218>And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior 
principles of the soul?</P>
<P id=id04219>No doubt.</P>
<P id=id04220>This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I 
said that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own 
proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends and 
associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason, and 
that they have no true or healthy aim.</P>
<P id=id04221>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id04222>The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has 
inferior offspring.</P>
<P id=id04223>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04224>And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the 
hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?</P>
<P id=id04225>Probably the same would be true of poetry.</P>
<P id=id04226>Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of 
painting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which 
poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.</P>
<P id=id04227>By all means.</P>
<P id=id04228>We may state the question thus:—Imitation imitates the actions of 
men, whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or bad 
result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there anything 
more?</P>
<P id=id04229>No, there is nothing else.</P>
<P id=id04230>But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with 
himself—or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and 
opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there not 
strife and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the question 
again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the soul has 
been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions 
occurring at the same moment?</P>
<P id=id04231>And we were right, he said.</P>
<P id=id04232>Yes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission 
which must now be supplied.</P>
<P id=id04233>What was the omission?</P>
<P id=id04234>Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose 
his son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more 
equanimity than another?</P>
<P id=id04235>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04236>But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he 
cannot help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?</P>
<P id=id04237>The latter, he said, is the truer statement.</P>
<P id=id04238>Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against 
his sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?</P>
<P id=id04239>It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.</P>
<P id=id04240>When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things 
which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?</P>
<P id=id04241>True.</P>
<P id=id04242>There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him 
resist, as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge 
his sorrow?</P>
<P id=id04243>True.</P>
<P id=id04244>But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from 
the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles 
in him?</P>
<P id=id04245>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04246>One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?</P>
<P id=id04247>How do you mean?</P>
<P id=id04248>The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and 
that we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such 
things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also, because no 
human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the way of that which 
at the moment is most required.</P>
<P id=id04249>What is most required? he asked.</P>
<P id=id04250>That we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the 
dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best; not, 
like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck and wasting 
time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a 
remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen, banishing the cry of sorrow 
by the healing art.</P>
<P id=id04251>Yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of 
fortune.</P>
<P id=id04252>Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this 
suggestion of reason?</P>
<P id=id04253>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id04254>And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our 
troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call 
irrational, useless, and cowardly?</P>
<P id=id04255>Indeed, we may.</P>
<P id=id04256>And does not the latter—I mean the rebellious principle—furnish a 
great variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm temperament, 
being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when 
imitated, especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled 
in a theatre. For the feeling represented is one to which they are 
strangers.</P>
<P id=id04257>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04258>Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature 
made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the principle in the soul; 
but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is easily 
imitated?</P>
<P id=id04259>Clearly.</P>
<P id=id04260>And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the 
painter, for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have 
an inferior degree of truth—in this, I say, he is like him; and he is also like 
him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and therefore we shall 
be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered State, because he awakens 
and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason. As in a city 
when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the 
way, so in the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative poet implants an evil 
constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of 
greater and less, but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another 
small-he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth.</P>
<P id=id04261>Exactly.</P>
<P id=id04262>But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our 
accusation:—the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are 
very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?</P>
<P id=id04263>Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.</P>
<P id=id04264>Hear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a 
passage of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents some pitiful 
hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or weeping, and smiting 
his breast—the best of us, you know, delight in giving way to sympathy, and are 
in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most.</P>
<P id=id04265>Yes, of course I know.</P>
<P id=id04266>But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe 
that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality—we would fain be quiet and 
patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in the 
recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.</P>
<P id=id04267>Very true, he said.</P>
<P id=id04268>Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing 
that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own 
person?</P>
<P id=id04269>No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.</P>
<P id=id04270>Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view.</P>
<P id=id04271>What point of view?</P>
<P id=id04272>If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural 
hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and that 
this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and 
delighted by the poets;-the better nature in each of us, not having been 
sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic element to break 
loose because the sorrow is another's; and the spectator fancies that there can 
be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him 
what a good man he is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the 
pleasure is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem 
too? Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil of other 
men something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of 
sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is 
with difficulty repressed in our own.</P>
<P id=id04273>How very true!</P>
<P id=id04274>And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests 
which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or 
indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are 
not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;—the case of pity is repeated;—there 
is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this 
which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a 
buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the 
theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet 
at home.</P>
<P id=id04275>Quite true, he said.</P>
<P id=id04276>And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other 
affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable 
from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of 
drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if 
mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.</P>
<P id=id04277>I cannot deny it.</P>
<P id=id04278>Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the 
eulogists of Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that 
he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and that 
you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your 
whole life according to him, we may love and honour those who say these 
things—they are excellent people, as far as their lights extend; and we are 
ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy 
writers; but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and 
praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our 
State. For if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in 
epic or lyric verse, not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent 
have ever been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our 
State.</P>
<P id=id04279>That is most true, he said.</P>
<P id=id04280>And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this 
our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending 
away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have described; for 
reason constrained us. But that she may impute to us any harshness or want of 
politeness, let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy 
and poetry; of which there are many proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping 
hound howling at her lord,' or of one 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 
'the mob of sages circumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars 
after all'; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between 
them. Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts 
of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a well-ordered 
State we shall be delighted to receive her—we are very conscious of her charms; 
but we may not on that account betray the truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you 
are as much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?</P>
<P id=id04281>Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.</P>
<P id=id04282>Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, 
but upon this condition only—that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or 
some other metre?</P>
<P id=id04283>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04284>And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers 
of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf: let 
them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and to human 
life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall 
surely be the gainers—I mean, if there is a use in poetry as well as a 
delight?</P>
<P id=id04285>Certainly, he said, we shall the gainers.</P>
<P id=id04286>If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who 
are enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they think 
their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after the manner of 
lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. We too are inspired by that 
love of poetry which the education of noble States has implanted in us, and 
therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest; but so long as she is 
unable to make good her defence, this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, 
which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may 
not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many. At all 
events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to 
be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her, 
fearing for the safety of the city which is within him, should be on his guard 
against her seductions and make our words his law.</P>
<P id=id04287>Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.</P>
<P id=id04288>Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, 
greater than appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one 
be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or under 
the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?</P>
<P id=id04289>Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe 
that any one else would have been.</P>
<P id=id04290>And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and 
rewards which await virtue.</P>
<P id=id04291>What, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of 
an inconceivable greatness.</P>
<P id=id04292>Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period 
of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with 
eternity?</P>
<P id=id04293>Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.</P>
<P id=id04294>And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space 
rather than of the whole?</P>
<P id=id04295>Of the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?</P>
<P id=id04296>Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and 
imperishable?</P>
<P id=id04297>He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are 
you really prepared to maintain this?</P>
<P id=id04298>Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too—there is no difficulty in 
proving it.</P>
<P id=id04299>I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this 
argument of which you make so light.</P>
<P id=id04300>Listen then.</P>
<P id=id04301>I am attending.</P>
<P id=id04302>There is a thing which you call good and another which you call 
evil?</P>
<P id=id04303>Yes, he replied.</P>
<P id=id04304>Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and 
destroying element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the 
good?</P>
<P id=id04305>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04306>And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as 
ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is 
of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything, or in 
almost everything, there is an inherent evil and disease?</P>
<P id=id04307>Yes, he said.</P>
<P id=id04308>And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, 
and at last wholly dissolves and dies?</P>
<P id=id04309>True.</P>
<P id=id04310>The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of 
each; and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for 
good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither good nor 
evil.</P>
<P id=id04311>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id04312>If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption 
cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature there 
is no destruction?</P>
<P id=id04313>That may be assumed.</P>
<P id=id04314>Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?</P>
<P id=id04315>Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now 
passing in review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.</P>
<P id=id04316>But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?—and here do not let 
us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when he is 
detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of the soul. Take 
the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease which wastes and 
reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of which we were just now 
speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and 
inhering in them and so destroying them. Is not this true?</P>
<P id=id04317>Yes.</P>
<P id=id04318>Consider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil 
which exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to the soul 
and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the 
body?</P>
<P id=id04319>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id04320>And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can 
perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be 
destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?</P>
<P id=id04321>It is, he replied.</P>
<P id=id04322>Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether 
staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the actual 
food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness of food 
communicates corruption to the body, then we should say that the body has been 
destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is disease, brought on by this; but 
that the body, being one thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which 
is another, and which does not engender any natural infection—this we shall 
absolutely deny?</P>
<P id=id04323>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04324>And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an 
evil of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can be 
dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?</P>
<P id=id04325>Yes, he said, there is reason in that.</P>
<P id=id04326>Either then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains 
unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife put 
to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest 
pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved to become more unholy 
or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body; but that 
the soul, or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil, can be 
destroyed by an external one, is not to be affirmed by any man.</P>
<P id=id04327>And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of 
men become more unjust in consequence of death.</P>
<P id=id04328>But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the 
soul boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil and 
unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that injustice, like 
disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and that those who take this 
disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has, and 
which kills them sooner or later, but in quite another way from that in which, 
at present, the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of 
their deeds?</P>
<P id=id04329>Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will 
not be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But I rather 
suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which, if it have the 
power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive—aye, and well awake too; so 
far removed is her dwelling-place from being a house of death.</P>
<P id=id04330>True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is 
unable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to be the 
destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else except that of 
which it was appointed to be the destruction.</P>
<P id=id04331>Yes, that can hardly be.</P>
<P id=id04332>But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether 
inherent or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be 
immortal?</P>
<P id=id04333>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04334>That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then 
the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not 
diminish in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the immortal 
natures must come from something mortal, and all things would thus end in 
immortality.</P>
<P id=id04335>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04336>But this we cannot believe—reason will not allow us—any more than 
we can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and 
difference and dissimilarity.</P>
<P id=id04337>What do you mean? he said.</P>
<P id=id04338>The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the 
fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?</P>
<P id=id04339>Certainly not.</P>
<P id=id04340>Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and 
there are many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now 
behold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must 
contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and then her 
beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the things which we 
have described will be manifested more clearly. Thus far, we have spoken the 
truth concerning her as she appears at present, but we must remember also that 
we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the 
sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly be discerned because his 
natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts 
of ways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and 
stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form. 
And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition, disfigured by ten 
thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there must we look.</P>
<P id=id04341>Where then?</P>
<P id=id04342>At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what 
society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal 
and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly following 
this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which 
she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and 
rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth, 
and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed: then you 
would see her as she is, and know whether she has one shape only or many, or 
what her nature is. Of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this 
present life I think that we have now said enough.</P>
<P id=id04343>True, he replied.</P>
<P id=id04344>And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the 
argument; we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as 
you were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her own 
nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. Let a man do 
what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and even if in addition 
to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of Hades.</P>
<P id=id04345>Very true.</P>
<P id=id04346>And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how 
many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure 
to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.</P>
<P id=id04347>Certainly not, he said.</P>
<P id=id04348>Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?</P>
<P id=id04349>What did I borrow?</P>
<P id=id04350>The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the 
unjust just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case 
could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought 
to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might be 
weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?</P>
<P id=id04351>I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.</P>
<P id=id04352>Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that 
the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to 
be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been shown to 
confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her, let what has 
been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that palm of appearance 
which is hers also, and which she gives to her own.</P>
<P id=id04353>The demand, he said, is just.</P>
<P id=id04354>In the first place, I said—and this is the first thing which you 
will have to give back—the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to 
the gods.</P>
<P id=id04355>Granted.</P>
<P id=id04356>And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the 
other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?</P>
<P id=id04357>True.</P>
<P id=id04358>And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them 
all things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary 
consequence of former sins?</P>
<P id=id04359>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04360>Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is 
in poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in the 
end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have a care of 
any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as far as man can 
attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of virtue?</P>
<P id=id04361>Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by 
him.</P>
<P id=id04362>And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?</P>
<P id=id04363>Certainly.</P>
<P id=id04364>Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the 
just?</P>
<P id=id04365>That is my conviction.</P>
<P id=id04366>And what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really 
are, and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run 
well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the goal: they 
go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish, slinking away with 
their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a crown; but the true 
runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned. And this is 
the way with the just; he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of 
his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to 
bestow.</P>
<P id=id04367>True.</P>
<P id=id04368>And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings 
which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them, what 
you were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers in 
their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give in 
marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say of these. 
And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater number, even though 
they escape in their youth, are found out at last and look foolish at the end of 
their course, and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by 
stranger and citizen; they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears 
polite, as you truly term them; they will be racked and have their eyes burned 
out, as you were saying. And you may suppose that I have repeated the remainder 
of your tale of horrors. But will you let me assume, without reciting them, that 
these things are true?</P>
<P id=id04369>Certainly, he said, what you say is true.</P>
<P id=id04370>These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are 
bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the 
other good things which justice of herself provides.</P>
<P id=id04371>Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.</P>
<P id=id04372>And yet, I said, all these are as nothing, either in number or 
greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and 
unjust after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and unjust 
will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to 
them.</P>
<P id=id04373>Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly 
hear.</P>
<H5 id=id04374>SOCRATES</H5>
<P id=id04375>Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which 
Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, Er the 
son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and ten days 
afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of 
corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and carried away home to be 
buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned 
to life and told them what he had seen in the other world. He said that when his 
soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came 
to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they were 
near together, and over against them were two other openings in the heaven 
above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who commanded the 
just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in 
front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like 
manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left 
hand; these also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. 
He drew near, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry 
the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see all that 
was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and saw on one side the 
souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been 
given on them; and at the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of 
the earth dusty and worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean and 
bright. And arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, 
and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a 
festival; and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls which 
came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above, and the souls which 
came from heaven about the things beneath. And they told one another of what had 
happened by the way, those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance 
of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth 
(now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above were 
describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The Story, 
Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:—He said that for 
every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold; or once in a 
hundred years—such being reckoned to be the length of man's life, and the 
penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years. If, for example, there 
were any who had been the cause of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved 
cities or armies, or been guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all 
of their offences they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of 
beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion. I need hardly 
repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were 
born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of murderers, there were 
retributions other and greater far which he described. He mentioned that he was 
present when one of the spirits asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' 
(Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the 
tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder 
brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.) The 
answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will never come. And 
this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed. We 
were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having completed all our experiences, were 
about to reascend, when of a sudden Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most 
of whom were tyrants; and there were also besides the tyrants private 
individuals who had been great criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about 
to return into the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a 
roar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been 
sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery aspect, who 
were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried them off; and Ardiaeus 
and others they bound head and foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed 
them with scourges, and dragged them along the road at the side, carding them on 
thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes, and 
that they were being taken away to be cast into hell.' And of all the many 
terrors which they had endured, he said that there was none like the terror 
which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice; and 
when there was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said 
Er, were the penalties and retributions, and there were blessings as great.</P>
<P id=id04376>Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven 
days, on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on the 
fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could see from 
above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right through the whole 
heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the rainbow, only brighter 
and purer; another day's journey brought them to the place, and there, in the 
midst of the light, they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from 
above: for this light is the belt of heaven, and holds together the circle of 
the universe, like the under-girders of a trireme. From these ends is extended 
the spindle of Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn. The shaft and hook 
of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and 
also partly of other materials. Now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on 
earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl 
which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and 
another, and another, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which 
fit into one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on 
their lower side all together form one continuous whorl. This is pierced by the 
spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the eighth. The first and 
outermost whorl has the rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, 
in the following proportions—the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth 
next to the sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is 
sixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second. The largest (of 
fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the eighth (or 
moon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the second and fifth 
(Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another, and yellower than the 
preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest light; the fourth (Mars) is 
reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness second. Now the whole spindle has 
the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one direction, the seven inner 
circles move slowly in the other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next 
in swiftness are the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in 
swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the 
fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle turns on the 
knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes 
round with them, hymning a single tone or note. The eight together form one 
harmony; and round about, at equal intervals, there is another band, three in 
number, each sitting upon her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of 
Necessity, who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, 
Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of 
the sirens—Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of the 
future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the 
revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and Atropos with her 
left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and Lachesis laying hold of 
either in turn, first with one hand and then with the other.</P>
<P id=id04377>When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to 
Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order; then 
he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives, and having mounted 
a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the word of Lachesis, the daughter of 
Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and mortality. Your genius 
will not be allotted to you, but you choose your genius; and let him who draws 
the first lot have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his 
destiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have 
more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser—God is justified.' 
When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them 
all, and each of them took up the lot which fell near him, all but Er himself 
(he was not allowed), and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he 
had obtained. Then the Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples 
of lives; and there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were 
of all sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition. 
And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life, others 
which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and 
beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were famous for their form 
and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games, or, again, for 
their birth and the qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the reverse 
of famous for the opposite qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, 
however, any definite character them, because the soul, when choosing a new 
life, must of necessity become different. But there was every other quality, and 
the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and poverty, 
and disease and health; and there were mean states also. And here, my dear 
Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and therefore the utmost care 
should be taken. Let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek 
and follow one thing only, if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find 
some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and 
so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He 
should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned 
severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect of beauty 
is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul, and what are the 
good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth, of private and public 
station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the 
soul, and the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature 
of the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able 
to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so he will choose, 
giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust, and 
good to the life which will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. 
For we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after 
death. A man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in 
truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or 
the other allurements of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and similar 
villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself; 
but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, 
as far as possible, not only in this life but in all that which is to come. For 
this is the way of happiness.</P>
<P id=id04378>And according to the report of the messenger from the other world 
this was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if he 
chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not 
undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless, and let not 
the last despair.' And when he had spoken, he who had the first choice came 
forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny; his mind having been 
darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not thought out the whole matter before 
he chose, and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated, among other 
evils, to devour his own children. But when he had time to reflect, and saw what 
was in the lot, he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, 
forgetting the proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame 
of his misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything 
rather than himself. Now he was one of those who came from heaven, and in a 
former life had dwelt in a well-ordered State, but his virtue was a matter of 
habit only, and he had no philosophy. And it was true of others who were 
similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them came from heaven and 
therefore they had never been schooled by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came 
from earth, having themselves suffered and seen others suffer, were not in a 
hurry to choose. And owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also because the 
lot was a chance, many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an 
evil for a good. For if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated 
himself from the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate in 
the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy here, and 
also his journey to another life and return to this, instead of being rough and 
underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most curious, he said, was the 
spectacle—sad and laughable and strange; for the choice of the souls was in most 
cases based on their experience of a previous life. There he saw the soul which 
had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of 
women, hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he 
beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on 
the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men. The soul 
which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul 
of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice 
which was done him the judgment about the arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took 
the life of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his 
sufferings. About the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great 
fame of an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there 
followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a 
woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose, the soul of 
the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. There came also the 
soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to be the 
last of them all. Now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of 
ambition, and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a 
private man who had no cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was 
lying about and had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he 
said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last, and 
that he was delighted to have it. And not only did men pass into animals, but I 
must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one 
another and into corresponding human natures—the good into the gentle and the 
evil into the savage, in all sorts of combinations.</P>
<P id=id04379>All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the 
order of their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had 
severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the 
choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew them within the 
revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus ratifying the destiny of 
each; and then, when they were fastened to this, carried them to Atropos, who 
spun the threads and made them irreversible, whence without turning round they 
passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they 
marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren 
waste destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped by 
the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this they were 
all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were not saved by wisdom 
drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things. Now 
after they had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there was a 
thunderstorm and earthquake, and then in an instant they were driven upwards in 
all manner of ways to their birth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered 
from drinking the water. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the 
body he could not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself 
lying on the pyre.</P>
<P id=id04380>And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, 
and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass safely 
over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled. Wherefore my 
counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice 
and virtue always, considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure 
every sort of good and every sort of evil. Thus shall we live dear to one 
another and to the gods, both while remaining here and when, like conquerors in 
the games who go round to gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be 
well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which 
we have been describing.</P>

<P id=id04391>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we 
do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, 
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all 
references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will 
support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic 
works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms 
of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the 
work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this 
work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

<H5 id=id04409>1.F.</H5>
<P id=id04410>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend 
considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and 
proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection. 
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on 
which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, 
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or 
other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other 
medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by 
your equipment.</P>
<P id=id04411>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the 
"Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project 
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm 
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic 
work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and

NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT 
THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK

the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical 
medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or 
entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a 
replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, 
the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second 
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the 
second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without 
further opportunities to fix the problem.</P>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any 
disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the 
state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make

invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void 
the remaining provisions.</P>

liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or 
indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) 
distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, 
modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and 
(c) any Defect you cause.</P>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id04416>Section 2. Information about the Mission 
of Project Gutenberg-tm</H4>
<P id=id04417>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of 
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers 
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the 
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of 
life.</P>
<P id=id04418>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the 
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and 
ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available 
for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project 
Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg 
Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see 
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</P>
<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id04419>Section 3. Information about the Project 
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</H4>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of 
Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The 
Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Its 
501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising. Contributions to the

<H4 style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id04423>Section 4. Information about Donations to 
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</H4>
<P id=id04424>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide 
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the 
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in 
machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including 
outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly 
important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</P>
<P id=id04425>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating 
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. 
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much 
paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not 
solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation 
of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any 
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</P>
<P id=id04426>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where 
we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against 
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with 
offers to donate.</P>
<P id=id04427>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot 
make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside 
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</P>
<P id=id04428>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation 
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways 
including including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To 
donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</P>

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</H4>
<P id=id04430>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project 
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely 
shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project 
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 2em" id=id04431>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often 
created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public 
Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not 
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</P>
