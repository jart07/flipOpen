<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
THE TERRIBLE SECRET</h2>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong> they first went to live at Three
Chimneys, the children had talked a great deal about their Father, and had
asked a great many questions about him, and what he was doing and where he
was and when he would come home. Mother always answered their questions as
well as she could. But as the time went on they grew to speak less of him.
Bobbie had felt almost from the first that for some strange miserable
reason these questions hurt Mother and made her sad. And little by little
the others came to have this feeling, too, though they could not have put
it into words.</p>
<p>One day when Mother was working so hard that she could not leave off
even for ten minutes, Bobbie carried up her tea to the big bare room that
they called Mother&rsquo;s workshop. It had hardly any furniture. Just a
table and a chair and a rug. But always big pots of flowers on the window-sills and on the mantelpiece. The children saw to that. And from
the three long uncurtained windows the beautiful stretch of meadow and
moorland, the far violet of the hills, and the unchanging changefulness of
cloud and sky.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p205" name="205">

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your tea, Mother-love,&rdquo; said Bobbie; &ldquo;do
drink it while it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother laid down her pen among the pages that were scattered all over
the table, pages covered with her writing, which was almost as plain as
print, and much prettier. She ran her hands into her hair, as if she were
going to pull it out by handfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear head,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;does it
ache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;not much,&rdquo; said Mother. &ldquo;Bobbie,
do you think Peter and Phil are <em>forgetting</em> Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bobbie, indignantly. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You none of you ever speak of him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie stood first on one leg and then on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We often talk about him when we&rsquo;re by ourselves,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to me,&rdquo; said Mother. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie did not find it easy to say why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; she said, and stopped. She went over to
the window and looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobbie, come here,&rdquo; said her Mother, and Bobbie came.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p206" name="206">

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mother, putting her arm round Bobbie and laying
her ruffled head against Bobbie&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;try to tell me,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie fidgeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;I thought you were so
unhappy about Daddy not being here, it made you worse when I talked about
him. So I stopped doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the others,&rdquo; said Bobbie. &ldquo;I
never said anything about <em>that</em> to them. But I expect they felt
the same about it as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobbie dear,&rdquo; said Mother, still leaning her head against
her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I have
had a great sorrow,&mdash;oh, terrible&mdash;worse than anything you can
think of, and at first it did hurt to hear you all talking of him as if
everything were just the same. But it would be much more terrible if you
were to forget him. That would be worse than anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble,&rdquo; said Bobbie, in a very little voice,&mdash;&ldquo;I promised I would never ask you any questions, and I
never have, have I? But&mdash;the trouble&mdash;it won&rsquo;t last
always?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p207" name="207">
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mother, &ldquo;the worst will be over when Father
comes home to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could comfort you,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, do you suppose you don&rsquo;t? What should I do
without you&mdash;you and the others? Do you think I haven&rsquo;t noticed
how good you&rsquo;ve all been, not quarrelling nearly as much as you used
to&mdash;and all the little kind things you do for me&mdash;the flowers,
and cleaning my shoes, and tearing up to make my bed before I get time to
do it myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie had sometimes wondered whether Mother noticed these things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>must</em> get on with my work,&rdquo; said Mother,
giving Bobbie one last squeeze. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening in the hour before bed-time instead of reading to the
children Mother told them stories of the games she and Father used to have
when they were children and lived near each other in the
country&mdash;tales of the adventures of Father with Mother&rsquo;s brothers
when they were all boys together. Very funny stories they were, and the children laughed as they
listened.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p208" name="208">
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Edward died before he was grown up, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
said Phyllis, as Mother lighted the bedroom candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Mother, &ldquo;you would have loved him.
He was such a brave boy, and so adventurous. Always in mischief, and yet
friends with everybody in spite of it. And your Uncle Reggie&rsquo;s in
Ceylon&mdash;yes, and Father&rsquo;s away, too. But I think they&rsquo;d all
like to think we&rsquo;d enjoyed talking about the things they used to do.
Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Uncle Edward,&rdquo; said Phyllis, in a shocked tone;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s in Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;s forgotten us and all the old
times, because God has taken him, any more than I forget him. Oh, no, he
remembers. He&rsquo;s only away for a little time. We shall see him some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Uncle Reggie&mdash;and Father, too?&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mother. &ldquo;Uncle Reggie and Father, too.
Good night, my darlings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said every one. Bobbie hugged her mother more
closely even than usual, and whispered in her ear, &ldquo;Oh, I do love you so, Mummy&mdash;I do&mdash;I
do&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p209" name="209">
<p>When Bobbie came to think it all over, she tried not to wonder what the
great trouble was. But she could not always help it. Father was not
dead&mdash;like poor Uncle Edward&mdash;Mother had said so. And he was not
ill, or Mother would have been with him. Being poor wasn&rsquo;t the
trouble. Bobbie knew it was something nearer the heart than money could
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t try to think what it is,&rdquo; she told herself;
&ldquo;no, I mustn&rsquo;t. I <em>am</em> glad Mother noticed about us
not quarrelling so much. We&rsquo;ll keep that up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And alas, that very afternoon she and Peter had what Peter called a
first-class shindy.</p>
<p>They had not been a week at Three Chimneys before they had asked Mother
to let them have a piece of garden each for their very own, and she had
agreed, and the south border under the peach trees had been divided into
three pieces and they were allowed to plant whatever they liked there.</p>
<p>Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock in
hers. The seeds came up and though they looked just like weeds, Phyllis believed that they would bear flowers some day. The Virginia Stock
justified her faith quite soon, and her garden was gay with a band of
bright little flowers, pink and white and red and mauve.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p210" name="210">
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t weed for fear I pull up the wrong things,&rdquo; she
used to say comfortably; &ldquo;it saves such a lot of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his,&mdash;carrots and onions and
turnips. The seed was given to him by the farmer who lived in the nice
black-and-white, wood-and-plaster house just beyond the bridge. He kept
turkeys and guinea fowls, and was a most amiable man. But Peter&rsquo;s
vegetables never had much of a chance, because he liked to use the earth of
his garden for digging canals, and making forts and earthworks for his toy
soldiers. And the seeds of vegetables rarely come to much in a soil that is
constantly disturbed for the purposes of war and irrigation.</p>
<p>Bobbie planted rose-bushes in her garden, but all the little new leaves
of the rose-bushes shrivelled and withered, perhaps because she moved them
from the other part of the garden in May, which is not at all the right
time of year for moving roses. But she would not own that they were dead,
and hoped on against hope, until the day when Perks came up to see the garden, and told her quite plainly that all her roses were as dead as door nails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only good for bonfires, Miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You just dig
&rsquo;em up and burn &rsquo;em, and I&rsquo;ll give you some nice fresh roots
outer my garden; pansies, and stocks, and sweet willies, and
forget-me-nots. I&rsquo;ll bring &rsquo;em along to-morrow if you get the
ground ready.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="pf210" name="">
<img src="illustrations/railway/nesbit-railway210.jpg" alt="The Railway Children, Illustrations by C.E. Brock" /></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p211" name="211">
<p>So next day she set to work, and that happened to be the day when Mother
had praised her and the others about not quarrelling. She moved the
rose-bushes and carried them to the other end of the garden, where the
rubbish heap was that they meant to make a bonfire of when Guy Fawkes day
came.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Peter had decided to flatten out all his forts and earthworks,
with a view to making a model of the railway-tunnel, cutting, embankment,
canal, aqueduct, bridges, and all.</p>
<p>So when Bobbie came back from her last thorny journey with the dead
rose-bushes, he had got the rake and was using it busily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> was using the rake,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m using it now,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had it first,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s my turn now,&rdquo; said Peter. And that was how
the quarrel began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always being disagreeable about nothing,&rdquo; said
Peter, after some heated argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the rake first,&rdquo; said Bobbie, flushed and defiant,
holding on to its handle.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p212" name="212">
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you I said this morning I meant to have it.
Didn&rsquo;t I, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis said she didn&rsquo;t want to be mixed up in their rows. And
instantly, of course, she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you remember you ought to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she doesn&rsquo;t remember&mdash;but she might say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d had a brother instead of two whiny little kiddy
sisters,&rdquo; said Peter. This was always recognised as indicating the
high-water mark of Peter&rsquo;s rage.</p>
<p>Bobbie made the reply she always made to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why little boys were ever invented,&rdquo; and
just as she said it she looked up, and saw the three long windows of
Mother&rsquo;s workshop flashing in the red rays of the sun. The sight
brought back those words of praise:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quarrel like you used to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh</em>!&rdquo; cried Bobbie, just as if she had been
hit, or had caught her finger in a door, or had felt the hideous sharp
beginnings of toothache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Phyllis.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p213" name="213">
<p>Bobbie wanted to say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel. Mother hates
it so,&rdquo; but though she tried hard, she couldn&rsquo;t. Peter was
looking too disagreeable and insulting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the horrid rake, then,&rdquo; was the best she could manage.
And she suddenly let go her hold on the handle. Peter had been holding on
to it too, firmly and pullingly, and now that the pull the other way was
suddenly stopped, he staggered and fell over backward, the teeth of the
rake between his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve you right,&rdquo; said Bobbie, before she could stop
herself.</p>
<p>Peter lay still for half a moment&mdash;long enough to frighten Bobbie a
little. Then he frightened her a little more, for he sat up&mdash;screamed
once&mdash;turned rather pale, and then lay back and began to shriek,
faintly but steadily. It sounded exactly like a pig being killed a quarter
of a mile off.</p>
<p>Mother put her head out of the window, and it wasn&rsquo;t half a minute
after that she was in the garden kneeling by the side of Peter who never
for an instant ceased to squeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened, Bobbie?&rdquo; Mother asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the rake,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;Peter was pulling at
it, so was Bobbie, and she let go and he went over.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p214" name="214">
<p>&ldquo;Stop that noise, Peter,&rdquo; said Mother. &ldquo;Come. Stop at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter used up what breath he had left in a last squeal and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mother, &ldquo;are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he was really hurt, he wouldn&rsquo;t make such a fuss,&rdquo;
said Bobbie, still trembling with fury; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not a
coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think my foot&rsquo;s broken off, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
Peter, huffily, and sat up. Then he turned quite white. Mother put her arm
round him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <em>is</em> hurt,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
fainted. Here, Bobbie, sit down and take his head on your lap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mother undid Peter&rsquo;s boots. As she took the right one off
something dripped from his foot on to the ground. It was red blood. And
when the stocking came off there were three red wounds in Peter&rsquo;s foot
and ankle, where the teeth of the rake had bitten him, and his foot was
covered with red smears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run for water&mdash;a basinful,&rdquo; said Mother, and Phyllis
ran. She upset most of the water out of the basin in her haste, and had to fetch more in a jug.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p215" name="215">
<p>Peter did not open his eyes again till Mother had tied her handkerchief
round his foot, and she and Bobbie had carried him in and laid him on the
brown wooden settle in the dining room. By this time Phyllis was halfway to
the Doctor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mother sat by Peter and bathed his foot and talked to him, and Bobbie
went out and got tea ready, and put in the kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I can do,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Oh,
suppose Peter should die, or be a helpless cripple for life, or have to
walk with crutches, or wear a boot with a sole like a log of
wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood by the back door reflecting on these gloomy possibilities, her
eyes fixed on the water-butt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never been born,&rdquo; she said, and she said it
out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, lawk a mercy, what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; asked a voice,
and Perks stood before her with a wooden trug basket full of green-leaved
things and soft, loose earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s hurt his
foot with a rake&mdash;three great gaping wounds, like soldiers get. And it
was partly my fault.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p216" name="216">
<p>&ldquo;That it wasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll go bail,&rdquo; said Perks.
&ldquo;Doctor seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phyllis has gone for the Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right; you see if he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Perks. &ldquo;Why, my father&rsquo;s second cousin had a hay-fork run into
him, right into his inside, and he was right as ever in a few weeks, all
except his being a bit weak in the head afterwards, and they did say that
it was along of his getting a touch of the sun in the hay-field, and not
the fork at all. I remember him well. A kind-&rsquo;earted chap, but soft,
as you might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie tried to let herself be cheered by this heartening
reminiscence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Perks, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t want to be
bothered with gardening just this minute, I dare say. You shew me where
your garden is, and I&rsquo;ll pop the bits of stuff in for you. And
I&rsquo;ll hang about, if I may make so free, to see the Doctor as he comes
out and hear what he says. You cheer up, Missie. I lay a pound he
ain&rsquo;t hurt, not to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was. The Doctor came and looked at the foot and bandaged it
beautifully, and said that Peter must not put it to the ground for at least
a week.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p217" name="217">
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be lame, or have to wear crutches or a lump on his
foot, will he?&rdquo; whispered Bobbie, breathlessly, at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt! no!&rdquo; said Dr. Forrest; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be as
nimble as ever on his pins in a fortnight. Don&rsquo;t you worry, little
Mother Goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was when Mother had gone to the gate with the Doctor to take his last
instructions and Phyllis was filling the kettle for tea, that Peter and
Bobbie found themselves alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says you won&rsquo;t be lame or anything,&rdquo; said
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, course I shan&rsquo;t, silly,&rdquo; said Peter, very much
relieved all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter, I <em>am</em> so sorry,&rdquo; said Bobbie, after
a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Peter, gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was <em>all</em> my fault,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t quarrelled, it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. I
knew it was wrong to quarrel. I wanted to say so, but somehow I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p218" name="218">
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drivel,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
have stopped if you &rdquo;had said it. Not likely. And besides, us rowing
hadn&rsquo;t anything to do with it. I might have caught my foot in the hoe,
or taken off my fingers in the chaff-cutting machine or blown my nose off with
fireworks. It would have been hurt just the same whether we&rsquo;d been
rowing or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I knew it was wrong to quarrel,&rdquo; said Bobbie, in tears,
&ldquo;and now you&rsquo;re hurt and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; said Peter, firmly, &ldquo;you just dry up.
If you&rsquo;re not careful, you&rsquo;ll turn into a beastly little
Sunday-school prig, so I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be a prig. But it&rsquo;s so hard not to be,
when you&rsquo;re really trying to be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The Gentle Reader may perhaps have suffered from this difficulty.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a jolly good thing it
wasn&rsquo;t you was hurt. I&rsquo;m glad it was me. There! If it had been
you, you&rsquo;d have been lying on the sofa looking like a suffering angel
and being the light of the anxious household and all that. And I
couldn&rsquo;t have stood it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would,&rdquo; said Peter.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p219" name="219">
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, children,&rdquo; said Mother&rsquo;s voice at the door.
&ldquo;Quarrelling again? Already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t quarrelling&mdash;not really,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s rows every time we
don&rsquo;t agree!&rdquo; When Mother had gone out again, Bobbie broke
out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, I <em>am</em> sorry you&rsquo;re hurt. But you are a
beast to say I&rsquo;m a prig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Peter, unexpectedly, &ldquo;perhaps I am. You
did say I wasn&rsquo;t a coward, even when you were in such a wax. The only
thing is&mdash;don&rsquo;t you be a prig, that&rsquo;s all. You keep your
eyes open and if you feel prigginess coming on just stop it in time.
See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s call it Pax,&rdquo; said Peter, magnanimously:
&ldquo;bury the hatchet in the fathoms of the past. Shake hands on it. I
say, Bobbie, old chap, I am tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was tired for many days after that, and the settle seemed hard and
uncomfortable in spite of all the pillows and bolsters and soft folded
rugs. It was terrible not to be able to go out. They moved the settle to
the window, and from there Peter could see the smoke of the trains winding
along the valley. But he could not see the trains.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p220" name="220">
<p>At first Bobbie found it quite hard to be as nice to him as she wanted
to be, for fear he should think her priggish. But that soon wore off, and both she and Phyllis were, as he observed, jolly good sorts. Mother sat
with him when his sisters were out. And the words, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not a
coward,&rdquo; made Peter determined not to make any fuss about the pain in
his foot, though it was rather bad, especially at night.</p>
<p>Praise helps people very much, sometimes.</p>
<p>There were visitors, too. Mrs. Perks came up to ask how he was, and so
did the Station Master, and several of the village people. But the time
went slowly, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish there was something to read,&rdquo; said Peter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read all our books fifty times over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the Doctor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Phyllis;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s sure to have some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only about how to be ill, and about people&rsquo;s nasty insides,
I expect,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that come out of trains when
people are tired of them,&rdquo; said Bobbie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down and
ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the girls went their two ways.</p>
<p>Bobbie found Perks busy cleaning lamps.</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p221" name="221">
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s the young gent?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, thanks,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s most
frightfully bored. I came to ask if you&rsquo;d got any Magazines you could
lend him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said Perks, regretfully, rubbing his ear with
a black and oily lump of cotton waste, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I think of
that, now? I was trying to think of something as &rsquo;ud amuse him only
this morning, and I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything better than a
guinea-pig. And a young chap I know&rsquo;s going to fetch that over for him
this tea-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely! A real live guinea! He will be pleased. But he&rsquo;d
like the Magazines as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Perks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
sent the pick of &rsquo;em to Snigson&rsquo;s boy&mdash;him what&rsquo;s just
getting over the pewmonia. But I&rsquo;ve lots of illustrated papers
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the pile of papers in the corner and took up a heap six
inches thick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just slip a bit of string
and a bit of paper round &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled an old newspaper from the pile and spread it on the table, and
made a neat parcel of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s lots of pictures, and
if he likes to mess &rsquo;em about with his paint-box, or coloured chalks
or what not, why, let him. <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t want
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p222" name="222">
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; said Bobbie, took the parcel, and
started. The papers were heavy, and when she had to wait at the level crossing while a train went by, she
rested the parcel on the top of the gate. And idly she looked at the
printing on the paper that the parcel was wrapped in.</p>
<p>Suddenly she clutched the parcel tighter and bent her head over it. It
seemed like some horrible dream. She read on&mdash;the bottom of the column
was torn off&mdash;she could read no further.</p>
<p>She never remembered how she got home. But she went on tiptoe to her
room and locked the door. Then she undid the parcel and read that printed
column again, sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands and feet icy cold
and her face burning. When she had read all there was, she drew a long
uneven breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now I know,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>What she had read was headed, &ldquo;End of the Trial. Verdict.
Sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name of the man who had been tried was the name of her Father. The
verdict was &ldquo;Guilty.&rdquo; And the sentence was &ldquo;Five
years&rsquo; Penal Servitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy,&rdquo; she whispered, crushing the paper hard,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not true&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe it. You never did!
Never, never, never!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="bookPage" id="p223" name="223">
<p>There was a hammering on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said the voice of Phyllis; &ldquo;tea&rsquo;s
ready, and a boy&rsquo;s brought Peter a guinea-pig. Come along
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bobbie had to.</p>
