<HEAD>CHAPTER I</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PSAMMEAD</HEAD>
<P><HI>THERE</HI> were once four children who spent their summer holidays
in a white house, happily situated between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One
day they had the good fortune to find in the sandpit a strange creature.
Its eyes were on long horns like snail&rsquo;s eyes, and it could move them
in and out like telescopes. It had ears like a bat&rsquo;s ears, and its
tubby body was shaped like a spider&rsquo;s and covered with thick soft
fur&mdash;and it had hands and feet like a monkey&rsquo;s. It told the
children&mdash;whose names were Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane&mdash;that
it was a Psammead or sand&hyphen;fairy. (Psammead is pronounced
Sammy&hyphen;ad.) It was old, old, old, and its birthday was almost at the
very beginning of everything. And it had been buried in the sand for
thousands of years. But it still kept its fairylikeness, and part of this
fairylikeness was its power to give people whatever they wished for. You
<PB ID="p16" N="16">
know fairies have always been able to do this. Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and
Jane now found their wishes come true; but, somehow, they never could think
of just the right things to wish for, and their wishes sometimes turned out
very oddly indeed. In the end their unwise wishings landed them in what
Robert called &ldquo;a very tight place indeed,&rdquo; and the Psammead
consented to help them out of it in return for their promise never never to
ask it to grant them any more wishes, and never to tell anyone about it,
because it did not want to be bothered to give wishes to anyone ever any
more. At the moment of parting Jane said politely&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we were going to see you again some day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And the Psammead, touched by this friendly thought, granted the wish.
The book about all this is called &ldquo;Five Children and It,&rdquo; and
it ends up in a most tiresome way by saying&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The children <EMPH>did</EMPH> see the Psammead again, but it was
not in the sandpit; it was&mdash;but I must say no more&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>The reason that nothing more could be said was that I had not then been
able to find out exactly when and where the children met the Psammead
again. Of course I knew they would meet it, because it was a beast of its
word, and when it said a thing would happen, that thing happened without
fail. How different from the people who tell us about what weather it is
going to be on
<PB ID="p17" N="17">
Thursday next, in London, the South Coast, and Channel!</P>
<P>The summer holidays during which the Psammead had been found and the
wishes given had been wonderful holidays in the country, and the children
had the highest hopes of just such another holiday for the next summer. The
winter holidays were beguiled by the wonderful happenings of &ldquo;The
Ph&oelig;nix and the Carpet,&rdquo; and the loss of these two treasures
would have left the children in despair, but for the splendid hope of their
next holiday in the country. The world, they felt, and indeed had some
reason to feel, was full of wonderful things&mdash;and they were really the
sort of people that wonderful things happen to. So they looked forward to
the summer holiday; but when it came everything was different, and very,
very horrid. Father had to go out to Manchuria to telegraph news about the
war to the tiresome paper he wrote for&mdash;the <BIBL>Daily
Bellower</BIBL>, or something like that, was its name. And Mother, poor
dear Mother, was away in Madeira, because she had been very ill. And The
Lamb&mdash;I mean the baby&mdash;was with her. And Aunt Emma, who was
Mother&rsquo;s sister, had suddenly married Uncle Reginald, who was
Father&rsquo;s brother, and they had gone to China, which is much too far
off for you to expect to be asked to spend the holidays in, however fond
your aunt and uncle may be of you. So the children were

left in the care of old Nurse, who lived in Fitzroy Street, near the
British Museum, and though she was always very kind to them, and indeed
spoiled them far more than would be good for the most grown&hyphen;up of
us, the four children felt perfectly wretched, and when the cab had driven
off with Father and all his boxes and guns and the sheepskin, with blankets
and the aluminium mess&hyphen;kit inside it, the stoutest heart quailed,
and the girls broke down altogether, and sobbed in each other&rsquo;s arms,
while the boys each looked out of one of the long gloomy windows of the
parlour, and tried to pretend that no boy would be such a muff as to
cry.</P>
<P>I hope you notice that they were not cowardly enough to cry till their
Father had gone; they knew he had quite enough to upset him without that.
But when he was gone everyone felt as if it had been trying not to cry all
its life, and that it must cry now, if it died for it. So they cried.</P>
<P>Tea&mdash;with shrimps and watercress&mdash;cheered them a little. The
watercress was arranged in a hedge round a fat glass salt&hyphen;cellar, a
tasteful device they had never seen before. But it was not a cheerful
meal.</P>
<P>After tea Anthea went up to the room that had been Father&rsquo;s, and
when she saw how dreadfully he wasn&rsquo;t there, and remembered how every
minute was taking him further and further from her, and nearer and nearer
to the guns of the Russians, she cried
<PB ID="p19" N="19">
a little more. Then she thought of Mother, ill and alone, and perhaps at
that very moment wanting a little girl to put eau&hyphen;de&hyphen;cologne
on her head, and make her sudden cups of tea, and she cried more than ever.
And then she remembered what Mother had said, the night before she went
away, about Anthea being the eldest girl, and about trying to make the
others happy, and things like that. So she stopped crying, and thought
instead. And when she had thought as long as she could bear she washed her
face and combed her hair, and went down to the others, trying her best to
look as though crying were an exercise she had never even heard of.</P>
<P>She found the parlour in deepest gloom, hardly relieved at all by the
efforts of Robert, who, to make the time pass, was pulling Jane&rsquo;s
hair&mdash;not hard, but just enough to tease.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a
palaver.&rdquo; This word dated from the awful day when Cyril had
carelessly wished that there were Red Indians in England&mdash;and there
had been. The word brought back memories of last summer holidays and
everyone groaned; they thought of the white house with the beautiful
tangled garden&mdash;late roses, asters, marigold, sweet mignonette, and
feathery asparagus&mdash;of the wilderness which someone had once meant to
make into an orchard, but which was now, as Father said, &ldquo;five acres
of thistles haunted by
<PB ID="p20" N="20">
the ghosts of baby cherry&hyphen;trees.&rdquo; They thought of the view
across the valley, where the lime&hyphen;kilns looked like Aladdin&rsquo;s
palaces in the sunshine, and they thought of their own sandpit, with its
fringe of yellowy grasses and pale, stringy&hyphen;stalked wild flowers,
and the little holes in the cliff that were the little sandmartens&rsquo;
little front doors. And they thought of the free fresh air smelling of
thyme and sweetbrier, and the scent of the wood&hyphen;smoke from the
cottages in the lane&mdash;and they looked round old Nurse&rsquo;s stuffy
parlour, and Jane said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, how different it all is!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was. Old Nurse had been in the habit of letting lodgings, till Father
gave her the children to take care of. And her rooms were furnished
&ldquo;for letting.&rdquo; Now it is a very odd thing that no one ever
seems to furnish a room &ldquo;for letting&rdquo; in a bit the same way as
one would furnish it for living in. This room had heavy dark red stuff
curtains&mdash;the colour that blood would not make a stain on&mdash;with
coarse lace curtains inside. The carpet was yellow, and violet, with bits
of grey and brown oilcloth in odd places. The fireplace had shavings and
tinsel in it. There was a very varnished mahogany chiffonier, or sideboard,
with a lock that wouldn&rsquo;t act. There were hard chairs&mdash;far too
many of them&mdash;with crochet antimacassars slipping off their seats, all
of which sloped the wrong way. The table wore a cloth of a cruel
<PB ID="p21" N="21">
green colour with a yellow chain&hyphen;stitch pattern round it. Over the
fireplace was a looking&hyphen;glass that made you look much uglier than
you really were, however plain you might be to begin with. Then there was a
mantelboard with maroon plush and wool fringe that did not match the plush;
a dreary clock like a black marble tomb&mdash;it was silent as the grave
too, for it had long since forgotten how to tick. And there were painted
glass vases that never had any flowers in, and a painted tambourine that no
one ever played, and painted brackets with nothing on them.</P>
<Q><L>&ldquo;And maple&hyphen;framed engravings of the Queen,</L><L>The
Houses of Parliament, the Plains of Heaven,</L><L>And of a
blunt&hyphen;nosed woodman&rsquo;s flat return.&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>There were two books&mdash;last December&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bradshaw,&rdquo;
and an odd volume of Plumridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commentary on
Thessalonians.&rdquo; There were&mdash;but I cannot dwell longer on this
painful picture. It was indeed, as Jane said, very different.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a palaver,&rdquo; said Anthea again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; said Cyril, yawning.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to have <EMPH>anything</EMPH> about,&rdquo;
said Robert kicking the leg of the table miserably.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play,&rdquo; said Jane, and her tone was
grumpy.</P>
<P>Anthea tried very hard not to be cross. She succeeded.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think I want
<PB ID="p22" N="22">
to be preachy or a beast in any way, but I want to what Father calls define
the situation. Do you agree?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fire ahead,&rdquo; said Cyril without enthusiasm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, then. We all know the reason we&rsquo;re staying here is
because Nurse couldn&rsquo;t leave her house on account of the poor learned
gentleman on the top&hyphen;floor. And there was no one else Father could
entrust to take care of us&mdash;and you know it&rsquo;s taken a lot of
money, Mother&rsquo;s going to Madeira to be made well.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane sniffed miserably.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Anthea in a hurry, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s think about how horrid it all is. I mean we
can&rsquo;t go to things that cost a lot, but we must do
<EMPH>something</EMPH>. And I know there are heaps of things you can see in
London without paying for them, and I thought we&rsquo;d go and see them.
We are all quite old now, and we haven&rsquo;t got The
Lamb&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane sniffed harder than before.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I mean no one can say &lsquo;No&rsquo; because of him, dear pet.
And I thought we <EMPH>must</EMPH> get Nurse to see how quite old we are,
and let us go out by ourselves, or else we shall never have any sort of a
time at all. And I vote we see everything there is, and let&rsquo;s begin
by asking Nurse to give us some bits of bread and we&rsquo;ll go to St
James&rsquo;s Park. There are ducks there, I know, we can feed them. Only
we must make Nurse let us go by ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p23" N="23">
<P>&ldquo;Hurrah for liberty!&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;but she
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes she will,&rdquo; said Jane unexpectedly.
&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> thought about that this morning, and I asked Father,
and he said yes; and what&rsquo;s more he told old Nurse we might, only he
said we must always say where we wanted to go, and if it was right she
would let us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Three cheers for thoughtful Jane,&rdquo; cried Cyril, now roused
at last from his yawning despair. &ldquo;I say, let&rsquo;s go
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they went, old Nurse only begging them to be careful of crossings,
and to ask a policeman to assist in the more difficult cases. But they were
used to crossings, for they had lived in Camden Town and knew the Kentish
Town Road where the trams rush up and down like mad at all hours of the day
and night, and seem as though, if anything, they would rather run over you
than not.</P>
<P>They had promised to be home by dark, but it was July, so dark would be
very late indeed, and long past bedtime.</P>
<P>They started to walk to St James&rsquo;s Park, and all their pockets
were stuffed with bits of bread and the crusts of toast, to feed the ducks
with. They started, I repeat, but they never got there.</P>
<P>Between Fitzroy Street and St James&rsquo;s Park there are a great many
streets, and, if you go the right way you will pass a great many shops that
you cannot possibly help stopping to look at. The children stopped to look
at
<PB ID="p24" N="24">
several with gold&hyphen;lace and beads and pictures and jewellery and
dresses, and hats, and oysters and lobsters in their windows, and their
sorrow did not seem nearly so impossible to bear as it had done in the best
parlour at No. 300, Fitzroy Street.</P>
<P>Presently, by some wonderful chance turn of Robert&rsquo;s (who had been
voted Captain because the girls thought it would be good for him&mdash;and
indeed he thought so himself&mdash;and of course Cyril couldn&rsquo;t vote
against him because it would have looked like a mean jealousy), they came
into the little interesting criss&hyphen;crossy streets that held the most
interesting shops of all&mdash;the shops where live things were sold. There
was one shop window entirely filled with cages, and all sorts of beautiful
birds in them. The children were delighted till they remembered how they
had once wished for wings themselves, and had had them&mdash;and then they
felt how desperately unhappy anything with wings must be if it is shut up
in a cage and not allowed to fly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It must be fairly beastly to be a bird in a cage,&rdquo; said
Cyril. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They went on, and Cyril tried to think out a scheme for making his
fortune as a gold&hyphen;digger at Klondyke, and then buying all the caged
birds in the world and setting them free. Then they came to a shop that
sold cats, but the cats were in cages, and the children could not help
wishing some one
<PB ID="p25" N="25">
would buy all the cats and put them on hearthrugs, which are the proper
places for cats. And there was the dog&hyphen;shop, and that was not a
happy thing to look at either, because all the dogs were chained or caged,
and all the dogs, big and little, looked at the four children with sad
wistful eyes and wagged beseeching tails as if they were trying to say,
&ldquo;Buy me! buy me! buy me! and let me go for a walk with you; oh, do
buy me, and buy my poor brothers too! Do! do! do!&rdquo; They almost said,
&ldquo;Do! do! do!&rdquo; plain to the ear, as they whined; all but one big
Irish terrier, and he growled when Jane patted him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Grrrrr,&rdquo; he seemed to say, as he looked at them from the
back corner of his eye&mdash;&ldquo;<EMPH>You</EMPH> won&rsquo;t buy me.
Nobody will&mdash;ever&mdash;I shall die chained up&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
know that I care how soon it is, either!&rdquo;</P>
<P>I don&rsquo;t know that the children would have understood all this,
only once they had been in a besieged castle, so they knew how hateful it
is to be kept in when you want to get out.</P>
<P>Of course they could not buy any of the dogs. They did, indeed, ask the
price of the very, very smallest, and it was sixty&hyphen;five
pounds&mdash;but that was because it was a Japanese toy spaniel like the
Queen once had her portrait painted with, when she was only Princess of
Wales. But the children thought, if the smallest was all that money, the
biggest would run into thousands&mdash;so they went on.</P>
<PB ID="p26" N="26">
<P>And they did not stop at any more cat or dog or bird shops, but passed
them by, and at last they came to a shop that seemed as though it only sold
creatures that did not much mind where they were&mdash;such as goldfish and
white mice, and sea&hyphen;anemones and other aquarium beasts, and lizards
and toads, and hedgehogs and tortoises, and tame rabbits and
guinea&hyphen;pigs. And there they stopped for a long time, and fed the
guinea&hyphen;pigs with bits of bread through the cage&hyphen;bars, and
wondered whether it would be possible to keep a sandy&hyphen;coloured
double&hyphen;lop in the basement of the house in Fitzroy Street.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose old Nurse would mind <EMPH>very</EMPH>
much,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;Rabbits are most awfully tame sometimes. I
expect it would know her voice and follow her all about.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d tumble over it twenty times a day,&rdquo; said Cyril;
&ldquo;now a snake&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any snakes, said Robert hastily, &ldquo;and
besides, I never could cotton to snakes somehow&mdash;I wonder
why.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Worms are as bad,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and eels and
slugs&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t like things that
haven&rsquo;t got legs.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Father says snakes have got legs hidden away inside of
them,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and he says <EMPH>we&rsquo;ve</EMPH> got tails hidden
away inside <EMPH>us</EMPH>&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t either of it come to
anything <EMPH>really</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;I hate things that
haven&rsquo;t any legs.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse when they have too many,&rdquo;
<PB ID="p27" N="27">
said Jane with a shudder, &ldquo;think of centipedes!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They stood there on the pavement, a cause of some inconvenience to the
passers&hyphen;by, and thus beguiled the time with conversation. Cyril was
leaning his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they had
inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one, and he was trying to
reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself into a ball
earlier in the interview, when a small, soft voice just below his elbow
said, quietly, plainly and quite unmistakably&mdash;not in any squeak or
whine that had to be translated&mdash;but in downright common
English&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Buy me&mdash;do&mdash;please buy me!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril started as though he had been pinched, and jumped a yard away from
the hutch.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come back&mdash;oh, come back!&rdquo; said the voice, rather
louder but still softly; &ldquo;stoop down and pretend to be tying up your
bootlace&mdash;I see it&rsquo;s undone, as usual.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril mechanically obeyed. He knelt on one knee on the dry, hot dusty
pavement, peered into the darkness of the hutch and found himself face to
face with&mdash;the Psammead!</P>
<P>It seemed much thinner than when he had last seen it. It was dusty and
dirty, and its fur was untidy and ragged. It had hunched itself up into a
miserable lump, and its long snail&rsquo;s eyes were drawn in quite tight
so that they hardly showed at all.</P>
<PB ID="p28" N="28">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet028"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p29" N="29">
<P>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as
though it would begin to cry in a minute, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the
creature who keeps this shop will ask a very high price for me. I&rsquo;ve
bitten him more than once, and I&rsquo;ve made myself look as common as I
can. He&rsquo;s never had a glance from my beautiful, beautiful eyes. Tell
the others I&rsquo;m here&mdash;but tell them to look at some of those low,
common beasts while I&rsquo;m talking to you. The creature inside
mustn&rsquo;t think you care much about me, or he&rsquo;ll put a price upon
me far, far beyond your means. I remember in the dear old days last summer
you never had much money. Oh&mdash;I never thought I should be so glad to
see you&mdash;I never did.&rdquo; It sniffed, and shot out its long
snail&rsquo;s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur.
&ldquo;Tell the others I&rsquo;m here, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly
what to do about buying me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot, stood up and addressed the
others in firm tones&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding&mdash;and
I appeal to your honour,&rdquo; an appeal which in this family was never
made in vain. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at that hutch&mdash;look at the white
rat. Now you are not to look at that hutch whatever I say.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He stood in front of it to prevent mistakes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now get yourselves ready for a great surprise. In that hutch
there&rsquo;s an old friend of ours&mdash;<EMPH>don&rsquo;t</EMPH>
look!&mdash;Yes; it&rsquo;s the Psammead,
<PB ID="p30" N="30">
the good old Psammead! it wants us to buy it. It says you&rsquo;re not to
look at it. Look at the white rat and count your money! On your honour
don&rsquo;t look!<CORR SIC="">&rdquo;</CORR></P>
<P>The others responded nobly. They looked at the white rat till they quite
stared him out of countenance, so that he went and sat up on his hind legs
in a far corner and hid his eyes with his front paws, and pretended he was
washing his face.</P>
<P>Cyril stooped again, busying himself with the other bootlace and
listened for the Psammead&rsquo;s further instructions.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;and ask the price of lots
of other things. Then say, &lsquo;What do you want for that monkey
that&rsquo;s lost its tail&mdash;the mangy old thing in the third hutch
from the end.&rsquo; Oh&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind <EMPH>my</EMPH>
feelings&mdash;call me a mangy monkey&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried hard enough to
look like one! I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll put a high price on
me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve bitten him eleven times since I came here the day
before yesterday. If he names a bigger price than you can afford, say you
wish you had the money.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t give us wishes. I&rsquo;ve promised never to
have another wish from you,&rdquo; said the bewildered Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly little idiot,&rdquo; said the Sand Fairy
in trembling but affectionate tones, &ldquo;but find out how much money
you&rsquo;ve got between you, and do exactly what I tell you.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p31" N="31">
<P>Cyril, pointing a stiff and unmeaning finger at the white rat, so as to
pretend that its charms alone employed his tongue, explained matters to the
others, while the Psammead hunched itself, and bunched itself, and did its
very best to make itself look uninteresting.</P>
<P>Then the four children filed into the shop.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How much do you want for that white rat?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Eightpence,&rdquo; was the answer.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And the guinea&hyphen;pigs?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Eighteenpence to five bob, according to the breed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And the lizards?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ninepence each.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And toads?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fourpence. Now look here,&rdquo; said the greasy owner of all
this caged life with a sudden ferocity which made the whole party back
hurriedly on to the wainscoting of hutches with which the shop was lined.
&ldquo;Lookee here. I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to have you a comin&rsquo;
in here a turnin&rsquo; the whole place outer winder, an&rsquo; prizing
every animile in the stock just for your larks, so don&rsquo;t think it! If
you&rsquo;re a buyer, <EMPH>be</EMPH> a buyer&mdash;but I never had a
customer yet as wanted to buy mice, and lizards, and toads, and guineas all
at once. So hout you goes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! wait a minute,&rdquo; said the wretched Cyril, feeling how
foolishly yet well&hyphen;meaningly he had carried out the Psammead&rsquo;s
<PB ID="p32" N="32">
instructions. &ldquo;Just tell me one thing. What do you want for the mangy
old monkey in the third hutch from the end?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The shopman only saw in this a new insult.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Mangy young monkey yourself,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;get along
with your blooming cheek. Hout you goes!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t be so cross,&rdquo; said Jane, losing her head
altogether, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see he really <EMPH>does</EMPH> want to
know <EMPH>that</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ho! does &rsquo;e indeed?&rdquo; sneered the merchant. Then he
scratched his ear suspiciously, for he was a sharp business man, and he
knew the ring of truth when he heard it. His hand was bandaged, and three
minutes before he would have been glad to sell the &ldquo;mangy old
monkey&rdquo; for ten shillings. Now&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ho! &rsquo;e does, does &rsquo;e,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then two
pun ten&rsquo;s my price. He&rsquo;s not got his fellow that monkey
ain&rsquo;t, nor yet his match, not this side of the equator, which he
comes from. And the only one ever seen in London. Ought to be in the Zoo.
Two pun ten, down on the nail, or <EMPH>hout</EMPH> you goes!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children looked at each other&mdash;twenty&hyphen;three shillings
and fivepence was all they had in the world, and it would have been merely
three and fivepence, but for the sovereign which Father had given to them
&ldquo;between them&rdquo; at parting.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only twenty&hyphen;three shillings and
fivepence,&rdquo; said Cyril, rattling the money in his pocket.</P>
<PB ID="p33" N="33">
<P>&ldquo;Twenty&hyphen;three farthings and somebody&rsquo;s own
cheek,&rdquo; said the dealer, for he did not believe that Cyril had so
much money.</P>
<P>There was a miserable pause. Then Anthea remembered, and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! I <EMPH>wish</EMPH> I had two pounds ten.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;So do I, Miss, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the man with bitter
politeness; &ldquo;I wish you &rsquo;ad, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea&rsquo;s hand was on the counter, something seemed to slide under
it. She lifted it. There lay five bright half sovereigns.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, I <EMPH>have</EMPH> got it after all,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s the money, now let&rsquo;s have the Sammy,... the
monkey I mean.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The dealer looked hard at the money, but he made haste to put it in his
pocket.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I only hope you come by it honest,&rdquo; he said, shrugging his
shoulders. He scratched his ear again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose I must let you have it,
but it&rsquo;s worth thribble the money, so it is&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>He slowly led the way out to the hutch&mdash;opened the door gingerly,
and made a sudden fierce grab at the Psammead, which the Psammead
acknowledged in one last long lingering bite.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, take the brute,&rdquo; said the shopman, squeezing the
Psammead so tight that he nearly choked it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bit me to the
marrow, it have.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The man&rsquo;s eyes opened as Anthea held out her arms.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me if it tears your
<PB ID="p34" N="34">
face off its bones,&rdquo; he said, and the Psammead made a leap from his
dirty horny hands, and Anthea caught it in hers, which were not very clean,
certainly, but at any rate were soft and pink, and held it kindly and
closely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t take it home like that,&rdquo; Cyril said,
&ldquo;we shall have a crowd after us,&rdquo; and indeed two errand boys
and a policeman had already collected.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you nothink only a paper&hyphen;bag, like what
we put the tortoises in,&rdquo; said the man grudgingly.</P>
<P>So the whole party went into the shop, and the shopman&rsquo;s eyes
nearly came out of his head when, having given Anthea the largest
paper&hyphen;bag he could find, he saw her hold it open, and the Psammead
carefully creep into it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if that there don&rsquo;t beat
cock&hyphen;fighting! But p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ve met the brute
afore.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cyril affably, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s an old friend
of ours.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d a known that,&rdquo; the man rejoined, &ldquo;you
shouldn&rsquo;t a had him under twice the money. &rsquo;Owever,&rdquo; he
added, as the children disappeared, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done so bad,
seeing as I only give five bob for the beast. But then there&rsquo;s the
bites to take into account!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children trembling in agitation and excitement, carried home the
Psammead, trembling in its paper&hyphen;bag.</P>
<P>When they got it home, Anthea nursed it,
<PB ID="p35" N="35">
and stroked it, and would have cried over it, if she hadn&rsquo;t
remembered how it hated to be wet.</P>
<P>When it recovered enough to speak, it said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Get me sand; silver sand from the oil and colour shop. And get me
plenty.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They got the sand, and they put it and the Psammead in the round bath
together, and it rubbed itself, and rolled itself, and shook itself and
scraped itself, and scratched itself, and preened itself, till it felt
clean and comfy, and then it scrabbled a hasty hole in the sand, and went
to sleep in it.</P>
<P>The children hid the bath under the girls&rsquo; bed, and had supper.
Old Nurse had got them a lovely supper of bread and butter and fried
onions. She was full of kind and delicate thoughts.</P>
<P>When Anthea woke the next morning, the Psammead was snuggling down
between her shoulder and Jane&rsquo;s.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You have saved my life,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I know that man
would have thrown cold water on me sooner or later, and then I should have
died. I saw him wash out a guinea&hyphen;pig&rsquo;s hutch yesterday
morning. I&rsquo;m still frightfully sleepy, I think I&rsquo;ll go back to
sand for another nap. Wake the boys and this doormouse of a Jane, and when
you&rsquo;ve had your breakfasts we&rsquo;ll have a talk.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <EMPH>you</EMPH> want any breakfast?&rdquo; asked
Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I daresay I shall pick a bit presently,&rdquo; it
<PB ID="p36" N="36">
said; &ldquo;but sand is all I care about&mdash;it&rsquo;s meat and drink
to me, and coals and fire and wife and children.&rdquo; With these words it
clambered down by the bedclothes and scrambled back into the bath, where
they heard it scratching itself out of sight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;anyhow our holidays won&rsquo;t
be dull <EMPH>now</EMPH>. We&rsquo;ve found the Psammead again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane, beginning to put on her stockings.
&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be <EMPH>dull</EMPH>&mdash;but it&rsquo;ll be only
like having a pet dog now it can&rsquo;t give us wishes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so discontented,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;If
it can&rsquo;t do anything else it can tell us about Megatheriums and
things.&rdquo;</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE HALF AMULET</HEAD>
<P><HI>LONG</HI> ago&mdash;that is to say last summer&mdash;the children,
finding themselves embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted
them, and which the servants had not received in a proper spirit, had
wished that the servants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead
gave. And when they parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that
they should meet it again. Therefore they <EMPH>had</EMPH> met it (and it
was jolly lucky for the Psammead, as Robert pointed out). Now, of course,
you see that the Psammead&rsquo;s, being where it was, was the consequence
of one of their wishes, and therefore was a Psammead&hyphen;wish, and as
such could not be noticed by the servants. And it was soon plain that in
the Psammead&rsquo;s opinion old Nurse was still a servant, although she
had now a house of her own, for she never noticed the Psammead at all. And
that was as well, for she would never
<PB ID="p38" N="38">
have consented to allow the girls to keep an animal and a bath of sand
under their bed.</P>
<P>When breakfast had been cleared away&mdash;it was a very nice breakfast
with hot rolls to it, a luxury quite out of the common way&mdash;Anthea
went and dragged out the bath, and woke the Psammead. It stretched and
shook itself.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You must have bolted your breakfast most unwholesomely,&rdquo; it
said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t have been five minutes over it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been nearly an hour,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;Come&mdash;you know you promised.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand
and shooting out its long eyes suddenly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better begin as
we mean to go on. It won&rsquo;t do to have any misunderstanding, so I tell
you plainly that&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>please</EMPH>,&rdquo; Anthea pleaded, &ldquo;do wait
till we get to the others. They&rsquo;ll think it most awfully sneakish of
me to talk to you without them; do come down, there&rsquo;s a
dear.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She knelt before the sand&hyphen;bath and held out her arms. The
Psammead must have remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same
little arms, only the day before, for it gave a little grudging grunt, and
jumped once more.</P>
<P>Anthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs. It was
welcomed in a thrilling silence.</P>
<P>At last Anthea said, &ldquo;Now then!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p39" N="39">
<P>&ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; asked the Psammead, shooting its eyes
out and turning them slowly round.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sitting&hyphen;room, of course,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Anthea kindly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take
you anywhere you like if you want us to. What was it you were going to say
upstairs when I said the others wouldn&rsquo;t like it if I stayed talking
to you without them?&rdquo;</P>
<P>It looked keenly at her, and she blushed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; it said sharply. &ldquo;Of course,
it&rsquo;s quite natural that you should like your brothers and sisters to
know exactly how good and unselfish you were.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;Anthea was
quite right. What was it you were going to say when she stopped
you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;since
you&rsquo;re so anxious to know. I was going to say this. You&rsquo;ve
saved my life&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not ungrateful&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t
change your nature or mine. You&rsquo;re still very ignorant, and rather
silly, and I am worth a thousand of you any day of the week.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course you are!&rdquo; Anthea was beginning but it interrupted
her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rude to interrupt,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;what I
mean is that I&rsquo;m not going to stand any nonsense, and if you think
what you&rsquo;ve done is to give you the right to pet me or make me demean
myself by playing with you, you&rsquo;ll find out that what you think
doesn&rsquo;t matter
<PB ID="p40" N="40">
a single penny. See? It&rsquo;s what <EMPH>I</EMPH> think that
matters.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;it always was, if you
remember.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;then that&rsquo;s settled.
We&rsquo;re to be treated as we deserve. I with respect, and all of you
with&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t wish to be offensive. Do you want me to tell
you how I got into that horrible den you bought me out of? Oh, I&rsquo;m
not ungrateful! I haven&rsquo;t forgotten it and I shan&rsquo;t forget
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do tell us,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re
awfully clever, but even with all your cleverness, I don&rsquo;t believe
you can possibly know how&mdash;how respectfully we do respect you.
Don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others all said yes&mdash;and fidgetted in their chairs. Robert
spoke the wishes of all when he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d go on.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So it sat up on the green&hyphen;covered table and went on.</P>
<P>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;d gone away,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;I went to sand
for a bit, and slept. I was tired out with all your silly wishes, and I
felt as though I hadn&rsquo;t really been to sand for a year.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;To sand?&rdquo; Jane repeated.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where I sleep. You go to bed. I go to sand.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane yawned; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy.</P>
<PB ID="p41" N="41">
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Psammead, in offended tones.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure <EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t want to tell you a long
tale. A man caught me, and I bit him. And he put me in a bag with a dead
hare and a dead rabbit. And he took me to his house and put me out of the
bag into a basket with holes that I could see through. And I bit him again.
And then he brought me to this city, which I am told is called the Modern
Babylon&mdash;though it&rsquo;s not a bit like the old Babylon&mdash;and he
sold me to the man you bought me of, and then I bit them both. Now,
what&rsquo;s your news?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not quite so much biting in our story,&rdquo; said
Cyril regretfully; &ldquo;in fact, there isn&rsquo;t any. Father&rsquo;s
gone to <SIC CORR="Manchuria">South Africa</SIC>, and Mother and The Lamb
have gone to Madeira because Mother was ill, and don&rsquo;t I just wish
that they were both safe home again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Merely from habit, the Sand&hyphen;fairy began to blow itself out, but
it stopped short suddenly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you any more
wishes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No&mdash;but look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t
we call in old Nurse and get her to say <EMPH>she</EMPH> wishes they were
safe home. I&rsquo;m sure she does.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No go,&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same
as your wishing yourself if you get some one else to wish for you. It
won&rsquo;t act.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But it did yesterday&mdash;with the man in the shop,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<PB ID="p42" N="42">
<P>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; said the creature, &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t
<EMPH>ask</EMPH> him to wish, and you didn&rsquo;t know what would happen
if he did. That can&rsquo;t be done again. It&rsquo;s played
out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t help us at all,&rdquo; said Jane;
&ldquo;oh&mdash;I did think you could do something! I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about it ever since we saved your life yesterday. I thought
you&rsquo;d be certain to be able to fetch back Father, even if you
couldn&rsquo;t manage Mother.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And Jane began to cry.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now <EMPH>don&rsquo;t</EMPH>,&rdquo; said the Psammead hastily;
&ldquo;you know how it always upsets me if you cry. I can&rsquo;t feel safe
a moment. Look here; you must have some new kind of charm.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easier said than done.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said the creature; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
one of the strongest charms in the world not a stone&rsquo;s throw from
where you bought me yesterday. The man that I bit so&mdash;the first one, I
mean&mdash;went into a shop to ask how much something cost&mdash;I think he
said it was a concertina&mdash;and while he was telling the man in the shop
how much too much he wanted for it, I saw the charm in a sort of tray, with
a lot of other things. If you can only buy <EMPH>that</EMPH>, you will be
able to have your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead. Then Cyril
coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was
thinking.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t be waxy,&rdquo; he said;
<PB ID="p43" N="43">
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s like this: when you used to give us our wishes they
almost always got us into some row or other, and we used to think you
wouldn&rsquo;t have been pleased if they hadn&rsquo;t. Now, about this
charm&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t got over and above too much tin, and if we
blue it all on this charm and it turns out to be not up to
much&mdash;well&mdash;you see what I&rsquo;m driving at, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see that <EMPH>you</EMPH> don&rsquo;t see more than the length
of your nose, and <EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> not far,&rdquo; said the
Psammead crossly. &ldquo;Look here, I <EMPH>had</EMPH> to give you the
wishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a sort of way, because you
hadn&rsquo;t the sense to wish for what was good for you. But this
charm&rsquo;s quite different. I haven&rsquo;t <EMPH>got</EMPH> to do this
for you, it&rsquo;s just my own generous kindness that makes me tell you
about it. So it&rsquo;s bound to be all right. See?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;please,
<EMPH>please</EMPH> don&rsquo;t. You see, it&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got;
we shan&rsquo;t have any more pocket&hyphen;money till Daddy comes
home&mdash;unless he sends us some in a letter. But we <EMPH>do</EMPH>
trust you. And I say, all of you,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you think it&rsquo;s worth spending <EMPH>all</EMPH> the money, if
there&rsquo;s even the chanciest chance of getting Father and Mother back
safe <EMPH>now</EMPH>? Just think of it! Oh, do let&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t care what you do,&rdquo; said the
Psammead; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to sand again till you&rsquo;ve made up
your minds.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p44" N="44">
<P>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said everybody; and Jane added, &ldquo;We
are quite mind&hyphen;made&hyphen;up&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see we are?
Let&rsquo;s get our hats. Will you come with us?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the Psammead; &ldquo;how else would you
find the shop?&rdquo;</P>
<P>So everybody got its hat. The Psammead was put into a flat
bass&hyphen;bag that had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of
filleted plaice in it. Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of
solid Psammead, and the children took it in turns to carry it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not half the weight of The Lamb,&rdquo; Robert said,
and the girls sighed.</P>
<P>The Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every now and
then, and told the children which turnings to take.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How on earth do you know?&rdquo; asked Robert. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t think how you do it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And the Psammead said sharply, &ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose you
can.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At last they came to <EMPH>the</EMPH> shop. It had all sorts and kinds
of things in the window&mdash;concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china
vases and tea&hyphen;cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols, lace
collars, silver spoons tied up in half&hyphen;dozens, and
wedding&hyphen;rings in a red lacquered basin. There were officers&rsquo;
epaulets and doctors&rsquo; lancets. There were tea&hyphen;caddies inlaid
with red turtle&hyphen;shell and brass curly&hyphen;wurlies, plates of
different kinds of money, and stacks of different kinds of plates. There
<PB ID="p45" N="45">
was a beautiful picture of a little girl washing a dog, which Jane liked
very much. And in the middle of the window there was a dirty silver tray
full of mother&hyphen;of&hyphen;pearl card counters, old seals, paste
buckles, snuff&hyphen;boxes, and all sorts of little dingy odds and
ends.</P>
<P>The Psammead put its head quite out of the fish&hyphen;basket to look in
the window, when Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tray there with rubbish in it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And then its long snail&rsquo;s eyes saw something that made them
stretch out so much that they were as long and thin as new
slate&hyphen;pencils. Its fur bristled thickly, and its voice was quite
hoarse with excitement as it whispered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it! There, under that blue and
yellow buckle, you can see a bit sticking out. It&rsquo;s red. Do you
see?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is it that thing something like a horse&hyphen;shoe?&rdquo; asked
Cyril. &ldquo;And red, like the common sealing&hyphen;wax you do up parcels
with?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;Now, you
do just as you did before. Ask the price of other things. That blue buckle
would do. Then the man will get the tray out of the window. I think
you&rsquo;d better be the one,&rdquo; it said to Anthea. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
wait out here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and
presently a large, dirty, short&hyphen;fingered hand with a very big
diamond ring came stretching through the green half&hyphen;
<PB ID="p46" N="46">
curtains at the back of the shop window and took away the tray.</P>
<P>They could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea
and the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had had time&mdash;if
she had had money&mdash;to buy everything in the shop before the moment
came when she stood before them, her face wreathed in grins, as Cyril said
later, and in her hand the charm.</P>
<P>It was something like this&mdash;
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet046"></FIGURE> and it was made of a red,
smooth,
softly shiny stone.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; Anthea whispered, just opening her hand
to give the others a glimpse of
<PB ID="p47" N="47">
it. &ldquo;Do let&rsquo;s get home. We can&rsquo;t stand here like
stuck&hyphen;pigs looking at it in the street.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So home they went. The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat
background to magic happenings. Down in the country among the flowers and
green fields anything had seemed&mdash;and indeed had been&mdash;possible.
But it was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so
near the Tottenham Court Road. But the Psammead was there&mdash;and it in
itself was wonderful. And it could talk&mdash;and it had shown them where a
charm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy. So
the four children hurried home, taking very long steps, with their chins
stuck out, and their mouths shut very tight indeed. They went so fast that
the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish&hyphen;bag, but it did not
say anything&mdash;perhaps for fear of attracting public notice.</P>
<P>They got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on the
green tablecloth.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for it was
quite faint. When it had refreshed itself a little it said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now then! Let me see the charm,&rdquo; and Anthea laid it on the
green table&hyphen;cover. The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at
it, then it turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s only half of it here!&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was indeed a blow.</P>
<PB ID="p48" N="48">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet048"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p49" N="49">
<P>&ldquo;It was all there was,&rdquo; said Anthea, with timid firmness.
She knew it was not her fault.</P>
<P>&ldquo;there should be another piece,&rdquo; said the Psammead,
&ldquo;and a sort of pin to fasten the two together.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t half any good?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it
work without the other bit?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It cost
seven&hyphen;and&hyphen;six.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, bother, bother,
bother!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly little idiots!&rdquo; said
everyone and the Psammead altogether.</P>
<P>Then there was a wretched silence. Cyril broke it&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go back to the shop and see if they haven&rsquo;t got the other
half,&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to sand till you come
back. Cheer up! Even the bit you&rsquo;ve got is <EMPH>some</EMPH> good,
but it&rsquo;ll be no end of a bother if you can&rsquo;t find the
other.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So Cyril went to the shop. And the Psammead to sand. And the other three
went to dinner, which was now ready. And old Nurse was very cross that
Cyril was not ready too.</P>
<P>The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and even
before he was near enough for them to see his face there was something
about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and the way
he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his errand had
been vain.</P>
<PB ID="p50" N="50">
<P>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; they all said, hoping against hope on the
front&hyphen;door step.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No go,&rdquo; Cyril answered; &ldquo;the man said the thing was
perfect. He said it was a Roman lady&rsquo;s locket, and people
shouldn&rsquo;t buy curios if they didn&rsquo;t know anything about
arky&mdash;something or other, and that he never went back on a bargain,
because it wasn&rsquo;t business, and he expected his customers to act the
same. He was simply nasty&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he was, and I want my
dinner.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was plain that Cyril was not pleased.</P>
<P>The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that
parlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone&rsquo;s spirits. Cyril had
his dinner, and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of
apple&hyphen;pudding there was a scratch at the door. Anthea opened it and
in walked the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; it said, when it had heard the news, &ldquo;things
might be worse. Only you won&rsquo;t be surprised if you have a few
adventures before you get the other half. You want to get it, of
course.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; was the general reply. &ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t
mind adventures.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;I seem to remember that
about you. Well, sit down and listen with all your ears. Eight, are there?
Right&mdash;I am glad you know arithmetic. Now pay attention, because I
don&rsquo;t intend to tell you everything twice over.&rdquo;</P>
<P>As the children settled themselves on the
<PB ID="p51" N="51">
floor&mdash;it was far more comfortable than the chairs, as well as more
polite to the Psammead, who was stroking its whiskers on the
hearth&hyphen;rug&mdash;a sudden cold pain caught at Anthea&rsquo;s heart.
Father&mdash;Mother&mdash;the darling Lamb&mdash;all far away. Then a warm,
comfortable feeling flowed through her. The Psammead was here, and at least
half a charm, and there were to be adventures. (If you don&rsquo;t know
what a cold pain is, I am glad for your sakes, and I hope you never
may.)</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Psammead cheerily, &ldquo;you are not
particularly nice, nor particularly clever, and you&rsquo;re not at all
good&hyphen;looking. Still, you&rsquo;ve saved my life&mdash;oh, when I
think of that man and his pail of water!&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll tell you all I
know. At least, of course I can&rsquo;t do that, because I know far too
much. But I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know about this red thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do! Do! Do! Do!&rdquo; said every one.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;This thing is half
of an amulet that can do all sorts of things; it can make the corn grow,
and the waters flow, and the trees bear fruit, and the little new beautiful
babies come. (Not that babies <EMPH>are</EMPH> beautiful, of course,&rdquo;
it broke off to say, &ldquo;but their mothers think they are&mdash;and as
long as you think a thing&rsquo;s true it <EMPH>is</EMPH> true as far as
you&rsquo;re concerned.&rdquo;)</P>
<P>Robert yawned.</P>
<P>The Psammead went on.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make people
unhappy&mdash;jealousy,
<PB ID="p52" N="52">
bad temper, pride, disagreeableness, greediness, selfishness, laziness.
Evil spirits, people called them when the Amulet was made. Don&rsquo;t you
think it would be nice to have it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said the children, quite without enthusiasm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And it can give you strength and courage.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And virtue.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s nice to have that,&rdquo; said Jane, but not
with much interest.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And it can give you your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; retorted the Psammead tartly, &ldquo;so
there&rsquo;s no need for you to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Heart&rsquo;s desire &rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; said
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; Anthea ventured, &ldquo;all that&rsquo;s what
the <EMPH>whole</EMPH> charm can do. There&rsquo;s something that the half
we&rsquo;ve got can win off its own bat&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; She
appealed to the Psammead. It nodded.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;the half has the power to take you
anywhere you like to look for the other half.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Does it know where to look?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead shook its head and answered,</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;we might as well
<PB ID="p53" N="53">
look for a needle in a bottle of hay. Yes&mdash;it <EMPH>is</EMPH> bottle,
and not bundle, Father said so.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the Psammead briskly; &ldquo;you think
you know everything, but you are quite mistaken. The first thing is to get
the thing to talk.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Can it?&rdquo; Jane questioned. Jane&rsquo;s question did not
mean that she thought it couldn&rsquo;t, for in spite of the parlour
furniture the feeling of magic was growing deeper and thicker, and seemed
to fill the room like a dream of a scented fog.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course it can. I suppose you can read.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; Every one was rather hurt at the question.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to read the name
that&rsquo;s written on the part of the charm that you&rsquo;ve got. And as
soon as you say the name out loud the thing will have power to
do&mdash;well, several things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a silence. The red charm was passed from hand to hand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no name on it,&rdquo; said Cyril at last.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the Psammead; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>that</EMPH>!&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not
reading. It looks like pictures of chickens and snakes and
things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was what was on the charm&mdash;
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet053"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p54" N="54">
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no patience with you,&rdquo; said the Psammead;
&ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t read you must find some one who can. A priest
now?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know any priests,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;we
know a clergyman&mdash;he&rsquo;s called a priest in the
prayer&hyphen;book, you know&mdash;but he only knows Greek and Latin and
Hebrew, and this isn&rsquo;t any of those&mdash;I know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never seen you,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;you
aren&rsquo;t any more good than so many stone images. Not so much, if
I&rsquo;m to tell the truth. Is there no wise man in your Babylon who can
pronounce the names of the Great Ones?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a poor learned gentleman upstairs,&rdquo; said
Anthea, &ldquo;we might try him. He has a lot of stone images in his room,
and iron&hyphen;looking ones too&mdash;we peeped in once when he was out.
Old Nurse says he doesn&rsquo;t eat enough to keep a canary alive. He
spends it all on stones and things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Try him,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;only be careful. If he
knows a greater name than this and uses it against you, your charm will be
of no use. Bind him first with the chains of honour and upright dealing.
And then ask his aid&mdash;oh, yes, you&rsquo;d better all go; you can put
me to sand as you go upstairs. I must have a few minutes&rsquo; peace and
quietness.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So the four children hastily washed their
<PB ID="p55" N="55">
hands and brushed their hair&mdash;this was Anthea&rsquo;s idea&mdash;and
went up to knock at the door of the &ldquo;poor learned gentleman,&rdquo;
and to &ldquo;bind him with the chains of honour and upright
dealing.&rdquo;</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PAST</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold. It was
mutton chop, and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in
the middle of a frozen pond, because the grease of the gravy had become
cold, and consequently white. It looked very nasty, and it was the first
thing the children saw when, after knocking three times and receiving no
reply, one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly to open the door.
The chop was on the end of a long table that ran down one side of the room.
The table had images on it and queer&hyphen;shaped stones, and books. And
there were glass cases fixed against the wall behind, with little strange
things in them. The cases were rather like the ones you see in
jewellers&rsquo; shops.</P>
<P>The &ldquo;poor learned gentleman&rdquo; was sitting at a table in the
window, looking at something very small which he held in a pair of fine
pincers. He had a round spy&hyphen;glass sort of thing in one
eye&mdash;which reminded the
<PB ID="p57" N="57">
children of watchmakers, and also of the long snail&rsquo;s eyes of the
Psammead.</P>
<P>The gentleman was very long and thin, and his long, thin boots stuck out
under the other side of his table. He did not hear the door open, and the
children stood hesitating. At last Robert gave the door a push, and they
all started back, for in the middle of the wall that the door had hidden
was a mummy&hyphen;case&mdash;very, very, very big&mdash;painted in red and
yellow and green and black, and the face of it seemed to look at them quite
angrily.</P>
<P>You know what a mummy&hyphen;case is like, of course? If you don&rsquo;t
you had better go to the British Museum at once and find out. Anyway, it is
not at all the sort of thing that you expect to meet in a top&hyphen;floor
front in Bloomsbury, looking as though it would like to know what business
<EMPH>you</EMPH> had there.</P>
<P>So everyone said, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; rather loud, and their boots
clattered as they stumbled back.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman took the glass out of his eye and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; in a very soft, quiet pleasant
voice&mdash;the voice of a gentleman who has been to Oxford.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s us that beg yours,&rdquo; said Cyril politely.
&ldquo;We are sorry to disturb you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the gentleman, rising&mdash;with the most
distinguished courtesy, Anthea told herself. &ldquo;I am delighted to see
you. Won&rsquo;t you sit down? No, not there; allow me to move that
papyrus.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p58" N="58">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet058"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p59" N="59">
<P>He cleared a chair, and stood smiling and looking kindly through his
large, round spectacles.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He treats us like grown&hyphen;ups,&rdquo; whispered Robert,
&ldquo;and he doesn&rsquo;t seem to know how many of us there
are.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t manners to
whisper. You say, Cyril&mdash;go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry to disturb you,&rdquo; said Cyril
politely, &ldquo;but we did knock three times, and you didn&rsquo;t say
&lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Run away now,&rsquo; or that you
couldn&rsquo;t be bothered just now, or to come when you weren&rsquo;t so
busy, or any of the things people do say when you knock at doors, so we
opened it. We knew you were in because we heard you sneeze while we were
waiting.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;do sit
down.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He has found out there are four of us,&rdquo; said Robert, as the
gentleman cleared three more chairs. He put the things off them carefully
on the floor. The first chair had things like bricks that tiny, tiny
birds&rsquo; feet have walked over when the bricks were soft, only the
marks were in regular lines. The second chair had round things on it like
very large, fat, long, pale beads. And the last chair had a pile of dusty
papers on it.</P>
<P>The children sat down.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We know you are very, very learned,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;and
we have got a charm, and we want you to read the name on it, because it
<PB ID="p60" N="60">
isn&rsquo;t in Latin or Greek, or Hebrew, or any of the languages
<EMPH>we</EMPH> know&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A thorough knowledge of even those languages is a very fair
foundation on which to build an education,&rdquo; said the gentleman
politely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Cyril blushing, &ldquo;but we only know them to
look at, except Latin&mdash;and I&rsquo;m only in C&aelig;sar with
that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The gentleman took off his spectacles and laughed. His laugh sounded
rusty, Cyril thought, as though it wasn&rsquo;t often used.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your
pardon. I think I must have been in a dream. You are the children who live
downstairs, are you not? Yes. I have seen you as I have passed in and out.
And you have found something that you think to be an antiquity, and
you&rsquo;ve brought it to show me? That was very kind. I should like to
inspect it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we didn&rsquo;t think about your liking to
inspect it,&rdquo; said the truthful Anthea. &ldquo;It was just for
<EMPH>us</EMPH> because we wanted to know the name on it&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;and, I say,&rdquo; Robert interjected, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t think it rude of us if we ask you first, before we show it, to
be bound in the what&hyphen;do&hyphen;you&hyphen;call&hyphen;it
of&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the bonds of honour and upright dealing,&rdquo; said
Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t quite follow you,&rdquo; said the
gentleman, with gentle nervousness.</P>
<PB ID="p61" N="61">
<P>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got part of a charm. And the Sammy&mdash;I mean, something told us it would
work, though it&rsquo;s only half a one; but it won&rsquo;t work unless we
can say the name that&rsquo;s on it. But, of course, if you&rsquo;ve got
another name that can lick ours, our charm will be no go; so we want you to
give us your word of honour as a gentleman&mdash;though I&rsquo;m sure, now
I&rsquo;ve seen you, that it&rsquo;s not necessary; but still I&rsquo;ve
promised to ask you, so we must. Will you please give us your honourable
word not to say any name stronger than the name on our charm?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The gentleman had put on his spectacles again and was looking at Cyril
through them. He now said&colon; &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; more than once,
adding, &ldquo;Who told you all this?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
sorry, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Some faint memory of a far&hyphen;off childhood must have come to the
learned gentleman just then, for he smiled.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is some sort of game that you
are engaged in? Of course! Yes! Well, I will certainly promise. Yet I
wonder how you heard of the names of power?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell you that either,&rdquo; said Cyril; and
Anthea said, &ldquo;Here is our charm,&rdquo; and held it out.</P>
<P>With politeness, but without interest, the gentleman took it. But after
the first glance
<PB ID="p62" N="62">
all his body suddenly stiffened, as a pointer&rsquo;s does when he sees a
partridge.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said in quite a changed voice, and carried
the charm to the window.</P>
<P>He looked at it; he turned it over. He fixed his spy&hyphen;glass in his
eye and looked again. No one said anything. Only Robert made a shuffling
noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up.</P>
<P>At last the learned gentleman drew a long breath.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where did you find this?&rdquo; he asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t find it. We bought it at a shop. Jacob Absalom
the name is&mdash;not far from Charing Cross,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We gave seven&hyphen;and&hyphen;sixpence for it,&rdquo; added
Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is not for sale, I suppose? You do not wish to part with it? I
ought to tell you that it is extremely valuable&mdash;extraordinarily
valuable, I may say.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we know that, so of course we want
to keep it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Keep it carefully, then,&rdquo; said the gentleman impressively;
&ldquo;and if ever you should wish to part with it, may I ask you to give
me the refusal of it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The refusal?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I mean, do not sell it to anyone else until you have given me the
opportunity of buying it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t. But we
<PB ID="p63" N="63">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet063"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p64" N="64">
don&rsquo;t want to sell it. We want to make it do things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose you can play at that as well as at anything
else,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid the days of
magic are over.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t <EMPH>really</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Anthea
earnestly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d see they aren&rsquo;t if I could tell you
about our last summer holidays. Only I mustn&rsquo;t. Thank you very much.
And can you read the name?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I can read it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Will you tell it us?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The name,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;is Ur Hekau
Setcheh.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ur Hekau Setcheh,&rdquo; repeated Cyril. &ldquo;Thanks awfully. I
do hope we haven&rsquo;t taken up too much of your time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;And do let me
entreat you to be very, very careful of that most valuable
specimen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They said &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in all the different polite ways they
could think of, and filed out of the door and down the stairs. Anthea was
last. Half&hyphen;way down to the first landing she turned and ran up
again.</P>
<P>The door was still open, and the learned gentleman and the
mummy&hyphen;case were standing opposite to each other, and both looked as
though they had stood like that for years.</P>
<P>The gentleman started when Anthea put her hand on his arm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be cross and say it&rsquo;s not
<PB ID="p65" N="65">
my business,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but do look at your chop! Don&rsquo;t
you think you ought to eat it? Father forgets his dinner sometimes when
he&rsquo;s writing, and Mother always says I ought to remind him if
she&rsquo;s not at home to do it herself, because it&rsquo;s so bad to miss
your regular meals. So I thought perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my
reminding you, because you don&rsquo;t seem to have anyone else to do
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She glanced at the mummy&hyphen;case; <EMPH>it</EMPH> certainly did not
look as though it would ever think of reminding people of their meals.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman looked at her for a moment before he
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear. It was a kindly thought. No, I haven&rsquo;t
anyone to remind me about things like that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He sighed, and looked at the chop.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It looks very nasty,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it does. I&rsquo;ll eat it
immediately, before I forget.&rdquo;</P>
<P>As he ate it he sighed more than once. Perhaps because the chop was
nasty, perhaps because he longed for the charm which the children did not
want to sell, perhaps because it was so long since anyone cared whether he
ate his chops or forgot them.</P>
<P>Anthea caught the others at the stair&hyphen;foot. They woke the
Psammead, and it taught them exactly how to use the word of power, and to
make the charm speak. I am not going to tell you how this is done, because
you might try to do it. And for
<PB ID="p66" N="66">
you any such trying would be almost sure to end in disappointment. Because
in the first place it is a thousand million to one against your ever
getting hold of the right sort of charm, and if you did, there would be
hardly any chance at all of your finding a learned gentleman clever enough
and kind enough to read the word for you.</P>
<P>The children and the Psammead crouched in a circle on the floor&mdash;in
the girls&rsquo; bedroom, because in the parlour they might have been
interrupted by old Nurse&rsquo;s coming in to lay the cloth for
tea&mdash;and the charm was put in the middle of the circle.</P>
<P>The sun shone splendidly outside, and the room was very light. Through
the open window came the hum and rattle of London, and in the street below
they could hear the voice of the milkman.</P>
<P>When all was ready, the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word. And
she said it.</P>
<P>Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go out. The room
was dark. The world outside was dark&mdash;darker than the darkest night
that ever was. And all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence
deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed of imagining. It was
like being suddenly deaf and blind, only darker and quieter even than
that.</P>
<P>But before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to be
frightened,
<PB ID="p67" N="67">
a faint, beautiful light began to show in the middle of the circle, and at
the same moment a faint, beautiful voice began to speak. The light was too
small for one to see anything by, and the voice was too small for you to
hear what it said. You could just see the light and just hear the
voice.</P>
<P>But the light grew stronger. It was greeny, like
glow&hyphen;worms&rsquo; lamps, and it grew and grew till it was as though
thousands and thousands of glow&hyphen;worms were signalling to their
winged sweethearts from the middle of the circle. And the voice grew, not
so much in loudness as in sweetness (though it grew louder, too), till it
was so sweet that you wanted to cry with pleasure just at the sound of it.
It was like nightingales, and the sea, and the fiddle, and the voice of
your mother when you have been a long time away, and she meets you at the
door when you get home.</P>
<P>And the voice said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Speak. What is it that you would hear?&rdquo;</P>
<P>I cannot tell you what language the voice used. I only know that
everyone present understood it perfectly. If you come to think of it, there
must be some language that everyone could understand, if we only knew what
it was. Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke, nor whether it was the
charm that spoke, or some presence in the charm. The children could not
have told you either. Indeed, they could not look at the charm while it was
speaking, because
<PB ID="p68" N="68">
the light was too bright. They looked instead at the green radiance on the
faded Kidderminster carpet at the edge of the circle. They all felt very
quiet, and not inclined to ask questions or fidget with their feet. For
this was not like the things that had happened in the country when the
Psammead had given them their wishes. That had been funny somehow, and this
was not. It was something like Arabian Nights magic, and something like
being in church. No one cared to speak.</P>
<P>It was Cyril who said at last&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Please we want to know where the other half of the charm
is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The part of the Amulet which is lost,&rdquo; said the beautiful
voice, &ldquo;was broken and ground into the dust of the shrine that held
it. It and the pin that joined the two halves are themselves dust, and the
dust is scattered over many lands and sunk in many seas.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; murmured Robert, and a blank silence fell.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all up?&rdquo; said Cyril at last;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use our looking for a thing that&rsquo;s smashed into
dust, and the dust scattered all over the place.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you would find it,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;You must seek
it where it still is, perfect as ever.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the Past you may find it,&rdquo; said the voice.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we <EMPH>may</EMPH> find it,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<PB ID="p69" N="69">
<P>The Psammead whispered crossly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? The
thing existed in the Past. If you were in the Past, too, you could find it.
It&rsquo;s very difficult to make you understand things. Time and space are
only forms of thought.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;and it
doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t, either. What I mean is that if you
were only made the right way, you could see everything happening in the
same place at the same time. Now do you see?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid <EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anthea;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m so stupid.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, you see this. That lost half of the Amulet is
in the Past. Therefore it&rsquo;s in the Past we must look for it. I
mustn&rsquo;t speak to the charm myself. Ask it things! Find
out!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where can we find the other part of you?&rdquo; asked Cyril
obediently.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the Past,&rdquo; said the voice.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What part of the Past?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I may not tell you. If you will choose a time, I will take you to
the place that then held it. You yourselves must find it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;When did you see it last?&rdquo; asked Anthea&mdash;&ldquo;I
mean, when was it taken away from you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The beautiful voice answered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That was thousands of years ago. The Amulet was perfect then, and
lay in a shrine, the last of many shrines, and I
<PB ID="p70" N="70">
worked wonders. Then came strange men with strange weapons and destroyed my
shrine, and the Amulet they bore away with many captives. But of these,
one, my priest, knew the word of power, and spoke it for me, so that the
Amulet became invisible, and thus returned to my shrine, but the shrine was
broken down, and ere any magic could rebuild it, one spoke a word before
which my power bowed down and was still. And the Amulet lay there, still
perfect, but enslaved. Then one coming with stones to rebuild the shrine,
dropped a hewn stone on the Amulet as it lay, and one half was sundered
from the other. I had no power to seek for that which was lost. And there
being none to speak the word of power, I could not rejoin it. So the Amulet
lay in the dust of the desert many thousand years, and at last came a small
man, a conqueror with an army, and after him a crowd of men who sought to
seem wise, and one of these found half the Amulet and brought it to this
land. But none could read the name. So I lay still. And this man dying and
his son after him, the Amulet was sold by those who came after to a
merchant, and from him you bought it, and it is here, and now, the name of
power having been spoken, I also am here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This is what the voice said. I think it must have meant Napoleon by the
small
<PB ID="p71" N="71">
man, the conqueror. Because I know I have been told that he took an army to
Egypt, and that afterwards a lot of wise people went grubbing in the sand,
and fished up all sorts of wonderful things, older than you would think
possible. And of these I believe this charm to have been one, and the most
wonderful one of all.</P>
<P>Everyone listened&colon; and everyone tried to think. It is not easy to
do this clearly when you have been listening to the kind of talk I have
told you about.</P>
<P>At last Robert said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Can you take us into the Past&mdash;to the shrine where you and
the other thing were together. If you could take us there, we might find
the other part still there after all these thousands of years.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Still there? silly!&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
see, if we go back into the Past it won&rsquo;t be thousands of years ago.
It will be <EMPH>now</EMPH> for us&mdash;won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He appealed
to the Psammead, who said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so far off the idea as you usually
are!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;will you take us back to when
there was a shrine and you were safe in it&mdash;all of you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;You must hold me up, and speak
the word of power, and one by one, beginning with the first&hyphen;born,
you shall pass through me into the Past. But let the last that passes be
the one that holds
<PB ID="p72" N="72">
me, and let him not lose his hold, lest you lose me, and so remain in the
Past for ever.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nasty idea,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;When you desire to return,&rdquo; the beautiful voice went on,
&ldquo;hold me up towards the East, and speak the word. Then, passing
through me, you shall return to this time and it shall be the present to
you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But how&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>A bell rang loudly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh crikey!&rdquo; exclaimed Robert, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s tea! Will
you please make it proper daylight again so that we can go down. And thank
you so much for all your kindness.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you!&rdquo;
added Anthea politely.</P>
<P>The beautiful light faded slowly. The great darkness and silence came
and these suddenly changed to the dazzlement of day and the great soft,
rustling sound of London, that is like some vast beast turning over in its
sleep.</P>
<P>The children rubbed their eyes, the Psammead ran quickly to its sandy
bath, and the others went down to tea. And until the cups were actually
filled tea seemed less real than the beautiful voice and the greeny
light.</P>
<P>After tea Anthea persuaded the others to allow her to hang the charm
round her neck with a piece of string.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It would be so awful if it got lost,&rdquo; she said&colon;
&ldquo;it might get lost anywhere, you know, and it would be rather beastly
for us to have to stay in the Past for ever and ever, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO</HEAD>
<P><HI>NEXT</HI> morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the
&ldquo;poor learned gentleman&rsquo;s&rdquo; breakfast. He did not
recognize her at first, but when he did he was vaguely pleased to see
her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see I&rsquo;m wearing the charm round my neck,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking care of it&mdash;like you told us
to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;did you have a good
game last night?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You will eat your breakfast before it&rsquo;s cold, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Yes, we had a splendid time. The charm made
it all dark, and then greeny light, and then it spoke. Oh! I wish you could
have heard it&mdash;it was such a darling voice&mdash;and it told us the
other half of it was lost in the Past, so of course we shall have to look
for it there!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked
anxiously at Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s natural&mdash;youthful imagina&hyphen;
<PB ID="p74" N="74">
tion and so forth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yet someone must have ... Who
told you that some part of the charm was missing?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know it seems
most awfully rude, especially after you being so kind about telling us the
name of power, and all that, but really, I&rsquo;m not allowed to tell
anybody anything about the&mdash;the&mdash;the person who told me. You
won&rsquo;t forget your breakfast, will you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned&mdash;not a
cross&hyphen;frown, but a puzzle&hyphen;frown.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall always be pleased if
you&rsquo;ll look in&mdash;any time you&rsquo;re passing you know&mdash;at
least ...&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;goodbye. I&rsquo;ll always tell
you anything I <EMPH>may</EMPH> tell.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He had not had many adventures with children in them, and he wondered
whether all children were like these. He spent quite five minutes in
wondering before he settled down to the fifty&hyphen;second chapter of his
great book on &ldquo;the Secret Rites of the Priests of Amen
R&amacr;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of
agitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past. That
idea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back again,
was anything but pleasing. Yet no one would have dared to suggest that the
charm should
<PB ID="p75" N="75">
not be used; and though each was in its heart very frightened indeed, they
would all have joined in jeering at the cowardice of any one of them who
should have uttered the timid but natural suggestion, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day, for
there was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner&hyphen;bell
would be able to reach back into the Past, and it seemed unwise to excite
old Nurse&rsquo;s curiosity when nothing they could say&mdash;not even the
truth&mdash;could in any way satisfy it. They were all very proud to think
how well they had understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about
Time and Space and things like that, and they were perfectly certain that
it would be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of
it. So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into
Regent&rsquo;s Park&mdash;and this, with the implied cold mutton and
tomatoes, was readily granted.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can get yourselves some buns or sponge&hyphen;cakes, or
whatever you fancy&hyphen;like,&rdquo; said old Nurse, giving Cyril a
shilling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go getting jam&hyphen;tarts, now&mdash;so
messy at the best of times, and without forks and plates ruination to your
clothes, besides your not being able to wash your hands and faces
afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off. They went round by
the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof
<PB ID="p76" N="76">
sheeting to put over the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past
when they got there. For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get
wet.</P>
<P>The sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. Women
were selling roses from big baskets&hyphen;full, and Anthea bought four
roses, one each, for herself and the others. They were red roses and smelt
of summer&mdash;the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about
Christmas&hyphen;time when you can only get mistletoe, which is pale right
through to its very scent, and holly which pricks your nose if you try to
smell it. So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon everyone
was sitting on the grass in Regent&rsquo;s Park under trees whose leaves
would have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were dusty and
yellowish, and brown at the edges.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go on with it,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and
as the eldest has to go first, you&rsquo;ll have to be last, Jane. You
quite understand about holding on to the charm as you go through,
don&rsquo;t you, Pussy?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t got to be last,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You shall carry the Psammead if you like,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; she added, remembering the beast&rsquo;s queer
temper, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;ll let you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead, however, was unexpectedly amiable.</P>
<PB ID="p77" N="77">
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;who
carries me, so long as it doesn&rsquo;t drop me. I can&rsquo;t bear being
dropped.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish&hyphen;basket
under one arm. The charm&rsquo;s long string was hung round her neck. Then
they all stood up. Jane held out the charm at arm&rsquo;s length, and Cyril
solemnly pronounced the word of power.</P>
<P>As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that Jane was
just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape. The
opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw that he could go through it.
All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and trampled grass of
Regent&rsquo;s Park, where the little ragged children were playing Ring
o&rsquo; Roses. But through the opening of it shone a blaze of blue and
yellow and red. Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his legs so that the
others should not see that his knees were trembling and almost knocking
together. &ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; he said, and, stepping up through the
arch, disappeared. Then followed Anthea. Robert, coming next, held fast, at
Anthea&rsquo;s suggestion, to the sleeve of Jane, who was thus dragged
safely through the arch. And as soon as they were on the other side of the
arch there was no more arch at all and no more Regent&rsquo;s Park either,
only the charm in Jane&rsquo;s hand, and it was its proper size again. They
were now in a light so bright that they
<PB ID="p78" N="78">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet078"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p79" N="79">
winked and blinked and rubbed their eyes. During this dazzling interval
Anthea felt for the charm and pushed it inside Jane&rsquo;s frock, so that
it might be quite safe. When their eyes got used to the new wonderful light
the children looked around them. The sky was very, very blue, and it
sparkled and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home when the sun shines
on it.</P>
<P>They were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest; there
were trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly undergrowth. In front of
them stretched a bank of strange black mud, then came the
browny&hyphen;yellowy shining ribbon of a river. Then more dry, caked mud
and more greeny&hyphen;browny jungle. The only things that told that human
people had been there were the clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd
arrangement of cut reeds in the river.</P>
<P>They looked at each other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;this <EMPH>is</EMPH> a change of
air!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was. The air was hotter than they could have imagined, even in London
in August.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish I knew where we were,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a river, now&mdash;I wonder whether it&rsquo;s the
Amazon or the Tiber, or what.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Nile,&rdquo; said the Psammead, looking out of the
fish&hyphen;bag.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then this is Egypt,&rdquo; said Robert, who had once taken a
geography prize.</P>
<PB ID="p80" N="80">
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any crocodiles,&rdquo; Cyril objected. His
prize had been for natural history.</P>
<P>The Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed to a
heap of mud at the edge of the water.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What do you call that?&rdquo; it said; and as it spoke the heap
of mud slid into the river just as a slab of badly mixed mortar will slip
from a bricklayer&rsquo;s trowel.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said everybody.</P>
<P>There was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the water.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a river&hyphen;horse!&rdquo; said the Psammead,
as a great beast like an enormous slaty&hyphen;blue slug showed itself
against the black bank on the far side of the stream.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hippopotamus,&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;it seems
much more real somehow than the one at the Zoo, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s being real on the other side of the
river,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>And now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them. This was
horrible. Of course it might be another hippopotamus, or a crocodile, or a
lion&mdash;or, in fact, almost anything.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Keep your hand on the charm, Jane,&rdquo; said Robert hastily.
&ldquo;We ought to have a means of escape handy. I&rsquo;m dead certain
this is the sort of place where simply anything <EMPH>might</EMPH> happen
to us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I believe a hippopotamus is going to
<PB ID="p81" N="81">
happen to us,&rdquo; said Jane&mdash;&ldquo;a very, very big
one.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They had all turned to face the danger.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly little duffers,&rdquo; said the Psammead in
its friendly, informal way; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a river&hyphen;horse.
It&rsquo;s a human.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was. It was a girl&mdash;of about Anthea&rsquo;s age. Her hair was
short and fair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you could see
that it would have been fair too if it had had a chance. She had every
chance of being tanned, for she had no clothes to speak of, and the four
English children, carefully dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings,
coats, collars, and all the rest of it, envied her more than any words of
theirs or of mine could possibly say. There was no doubt that hers was the
right costume for that climate.</P>
<P>She carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware. She did not
see the children, who shrank back against the edge of the jungle, and she
went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher. As she went she
made a strange sort of droning, humming, melancholy noise all on two notes.
Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl thought this noise was
singing.</P>
<P>The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river brink. Then she
waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds. She pulled
half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds, killing each as
she took it out, and threading it on a long osier
<PB ID="p82" N="82">
that she carried. Then she knotted the osier, hung it on her arm, picked up
the pitcher, and turned to come back. And as she turned she saw the four
children. The white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow against
the dark forest background. She screamed and the pitcher fell, and the
water was spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the fish, which
had fallen too. Then the water slowly trickled away into the deep
cracks.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; Anthea cried, &ldquo;we
won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the girl.</P>
<P>Now, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was
that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the girl.
<EMPH>You</EMPH>, at any rate, would not understand <EMPH>me</EMPH>, if I
tried to explain it, any more than you can understand about time and space
being only forms of thought. You may think what you like. Perhaps the
children had found out the universal language which everyone can
understand, and which wise men so far have not found. You will have noticed
long ago that they were singularly lucky children, and they may have had
this piece of luck as well as others. Or it may have been that ... but why
pursue the question further? The fact remains that in all their adventures
the muddle&hyphen;headed inventions which we call foreign languages never
bothered them in the least. They could always understand and be
under&hyphen;
<PB ID="p83" N="83">
stood. If you can explain this, please do. I daresay I could understand
your explanation, though you could never understand mine.</P>
<P>So when the girl said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; everyone understood at
once, and Anthea replied&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We are children&mdash;just like you. Don&rsquo;t be frightened.
Won&rsquo;t you show us where you live?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane put her face right into the Psammead&rsquo;s basket, and burrowed
her mouth into its fur to whisper&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is it safe? Won&rsquo;t they eat us? Are they
cannibals?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead shrugged its fur.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make your voice buzz like that, it tickles my
ears,&rdquo; it said rather crossly. &ldquo;You can always get back to
Regent&rsquo;s Park in time if you keep fast hold of the charm,&rdquo; it
said.</P>
<P>The strange girl was trembling with fright.</P>
<P>Anthea had a bangle on her arm. It was a sevenpenny&hyphen;halfpenny
trumpery brass thing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart of
turquoise blue hanging from it, and it was the gift of the
maid&hyphen;of&hyphen;all&hyphen;work at the Fitzroy Street house.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;this is for you. That is to show
we will not hurt you. And if you take it I shall know that you won&rsquo;t
hurt us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The girl held out her hand. Anthea slid the bangle over it, and the
girl&rsquo;s face lighted up with the joy of possession.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, looking lovingly at
<PB ID="p84" N="84">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet084"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p85" N="85">
the bangle; &ldquo;it is peace between your house and mine.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow path by
which she had come, and the others followed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This is something like!&rdquo; said Cyril, trying to be
brave.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from
feeling, &ldquo;this really and truly <EMPH>is</EMPH> an adventure! Its
being in the Past makes it quite different from the Ph&oelig;nix and Carpet
happenings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The belt of thick, growing acacia trees and shrubs&mdash;mostly prickly
and unpleasant&hyphen;looking&mdash;seemed about half a mile across. The
path was narrow and the wood dark. At last, ahead, daylight shone through
the boughs and leaves.</P>
<P>The whole party suddenly came out of the wood&rsquo;s shadow into the
glare of the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand, dotted
with heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson and
pink flowers among their shabby, sand&hyphen;peppered leaves. Away to the
right was something that looked like a grey&hyphen;brown hedge, and from
beyond it blue smoke went up to the bluer sky. And over all the sun shone
till you could hardly bear your clothes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That is where I live,&rdquo; said the girl pointing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; whispered Jane into the basket,
&ldquo;unless you say it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p86" N="86">
<P>The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence.
Perhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of doubt, for it merely
snarled&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go now I&rsquo;ll never help you
again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Oh</EMPH>,&rdquo; whispered Anthea, &ldquo;dear Jane,
don&rsquo;t! Think of Father and Mother and all of us getting our
heart&rsquo;s desire. And we can go back any minute. Come on!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Cyril, in a low voice, &ldquo;the Psammead
must know there&rsquo;s no danger or it wouldn&rsquo;t go. It&rsquo;s not
so over and above brave itself. Come on!&rdquo;</P>
<P>This Jane at last consented to do.</P>
<P>As they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a great
hedge about eight feet high, made of piled&hyphen;up thorn bushes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;To keep out foes and wild beasts,&rdquo; said the girl.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should think it ought to, too,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why, some
of the thorns are as long as my foot.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl through
it. A little way further on was another hedge, not so high, also of dry
thorn bushes, very prickly and spiteful&hyphen;looking, and within this was
a sort of village of huts.</P>
<P>There were no gardens and no roads. Just huts built of wood and twigs
and clay, and
<PB ID="p87" N="87">
roofed with great palm&hyphen;leaves, dumped down anywhere. The doors of
these houses were very low, like the doors of dog&hyphen;kennels. The
ground between them was not paths or streets, but just yellow sand trampled
very hard and smooth.</P>
<P>In the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what seemed
to be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden in Camden
Town.</P>
<P>No sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge than
dozens of men and women and children came crowding round from behind and
inside the huts.</P>
<P>The girl stood protectingly in front of the four children, and
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They are wonder&hyphen;children from beyond the desert. They
bring marvellous gifts, and I have said that it is peace between us and
them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it.</P>
<P>The children from London, where nothing now surprises anyone, had never
before seen so many people look so astonished.</P>
<P>They crowded round the children, touching their clothes, their shoes,
the buttons on the boys&rsquo; jackets, and the coral of the girls&rsquo;
necklaces.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do say something,&rdquo; whispered Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We come,&rdquo; said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a
dreadful day when he had had to wait in an outer office while his father
<PB ID="p88" N="88">
interviewed a solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the
<BIBL>Daily Telegraph</BIBL>&mdash;&ldquo;we come from the world where the
sun never sets. And peace with honour is what we want. We are the great
Anglo&hyphen;Saxon or conquering race. Not that we want to conquer
<EMPH>you</EMPH>,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;We only want to look at
your houses and your&mdash;well, at all you&rsquo;ve got here, and then we
shall return to our own place, and tell of all that we have seen so that
your name may be famed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril&rsquo;s speech didn&rsquo;t keep the crowd from pressing round and
looking as eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. Anthea had an
idea that these people had never seen woven stuff before, and she saw how
wonderful and strange it must seem to people who had never had any clothes
but the skins of beasts. The sewing, too, of modern clothes seemed to
astonish them very much. They must have been able to sew themselves, by the
way, for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore knickerbockers of
goat&hyphen;skin or deer&hyphen;skin, fastened round the waist with twisted
strips of hide. And the women wore long skimpy skirts of animals&rsquo;
skins. The people were not very tall, their hair was fair, and men and
women both had it short. Their eyes were blue, and that seemed odd in
Egypt. Most of them were tattooed like sailors, only more roughly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is this? What is this?&rdquo; they kept
<PB ID="p89" N="89">
asking touching the children&rsquo;s clothes curiously.</P>
<P>Anthea hastily took off Jane&rsquo;s frilly lace collar and handed it to
the woman who seemed most friendly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and look at it. And leave us
alone. We want to talk among ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found successful
when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he was told. The
tone was just as successful now. The children were left together and the
crowd retreated. It paused a dozen yards away to look at the lace collar
and to go on talking as hard as it could.</P>
<P>The children will never know what those people said, though they knew
well enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject of the talk.
They tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl&rsquo;s promise of
friendliness, but of course the thought of the charm was more comfortable
than anything else. They sat down on the sand in the shadow of the
hedged&hyphen;round place in the middle of the village, and now for the
first time they were able to look about them and to see something more than
a crowd of eager, curious faces.</P>
<P>They here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of
different coloured stone, and from these hung pendants of odd,
<PB ID="p90" N="90">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet090"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p91" N="91">
strange shapes, and some of them had bracelets of ivory and flint.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;what a lot we could teach them
if we stayed here!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I expect they could teach us something too,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;Did you notice that flint bracelet the woman had that Anthea gave
the collar to? That must have taken some making. Look here, they&rsquo;ll
get suspicious if we talk among ourselves, and I do want to know about how
they do things. Let&rsquo;s get the girl to show us round, and we can be
thinking about how to get the Amulet at the same time. Only mind, we
<EMPH>must</EMPH> keep together.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea beckoned to the girl, who was standing a little way off looking
wistfully at them, and she came gladly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell us how you make the bracelets, the stone ones,&rdquo; said
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;With other stones,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;the men make
them; we have men of special skill in such work.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any iron tools?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Iron,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you
mean.&rdquo; It was the first word she had not understood.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are all your tools of flint?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the girl, opening her eyes wide.</P>
<P>I wish I had time to tell you of that talk. The English children wanted
to hear all about this new place, but they also wanted
<PB ID="p92" N="92">
to tell of their own country. It was like when you come back from your
holidays and you want to hear and to tell everything at the same time. As
the talk went on there were more and more words that the girl could not
understand, and the children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her
what their own country was like, when they began to see how very few of the
things they had always thought they could not do without were really at all
necessary to life.</P>
<P>The girl showed them how the huts were made&mdash;indeed, as one was
being made that very day she took them to look at it. The way of building
was very different from ours. The men stuck long pieces of wood into a
piece of ground the size of the hut they wanted to make. These were about
eight inches apart; then they put in another row about eight inches away
from the first, and then a third row still further out. Then all the space
between was filled up with small branches and twigs, and then daubed over
with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and sticky like
putty.</P>
<P>The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and
arrows, and how they made boats with reeds and clay. Then she explained the
reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of. It was a
fish&hyphen;trap&mdash;just a ring of reeds set up in the water with only
one little opening in it, and in this opening, just below the water,
<PB ID="p93" N="93">
were stuck reeds slanting the way of the river&rsquo;s flow, so that the
fish, when they had swum sillily in, sillily couldn&rsquo;t get out again.
She showed them the clay pots and jars and platters, some of them
ornamented with black and red patterns, and the most wonderful things made
of flint and different sorts of stone, beads, and ornaments, and tools and
weapons of all sorts and kinds.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is really wonderful,&rdquo; said Cyril patronizingly,
&ldquo;when you consider that it&rsquo;s all eight thousand years
ago&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said the girl.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>isn&rsquo;t</EMPH> eight thousand years ago,&rdquo;
whispered Jane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <EMPH>now</EMPH>&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
just what I don&rsquo;t like about it. I say, <EMPH>do</EMPH> let&rsquo;s
get home again before anything more happens. You can see for yourselves the
charm isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in that place in the middle?&rdquo; asked Anthea,
struck by a sudden thought, and pointing to the fence.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the secret sacred place,&rdquo; said the girl in a
whisper. &ldquo;No one knows what is there. There are many walls, and
inside the insidest one <EMPH>It</EMPH> is, but no one knows what It is
except the headsmen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I believe <EMPH>you</EMPH> know,&rdquo; said Cyril, looking at
her very hard.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you this if you&rsquo;ll tell me,&rdquo; said
Anthea taking off a bead&hyphen;ring which had already been much
admired.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, catching eagerly at the
<PB ID="p94" N="94">
ring. &ldquo;My father is one of the heads, and I know a water charm to
make him talk in his sleep. And he has spoken. I will tell you. But if they
know I have told you they will kill me. In the insidest inside there is a
stone box, and in it there is the Amulet. None knows whence it came. It
came from very far away.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Have you seen it?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>The girl nodded.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is it anything like this?&rdquo; asked Jane, rashly producing the
charm.</P>
<P>The girl&rsquo;s face turned a sickly greenish white.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hide it, hide it,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You must put it
back. If they see it they will kill us all. You for taking it, and me for
knowing that there was such a thing. Oh, woe&mdash;woe! why did you ever
come here?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;they
shan&rsquo;t know. Jane, don&rsquo;t you be such a little jack&hyphen;ape
again&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. You see what will happen if you do. Now, tell
me&mdash;&rdquo; He turned to the girl, but before he had time to speak the
question there was a loud shout, and a man bounded in through the opening
in the thorn&hyphen;hedge.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Many foes are upon us!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Make ready the
defences!&rdquo;</P>
<P>His breath only served for that, and he lay panting on the ground.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>do</EMPH> let&rsquo;s go home!&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;Look here&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I
<EMPH>will</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p95" N="95">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet095"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p96" N="96">
<P>She held up the charm. Fortunately all the strange, fair people were too
busy to notice her. She held up the charm. And nothing happened.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t said the word of power,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>Jane hastily said it&mdash;and still nothing happened.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hold it up towards the East, you silly!&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Which <EMPH>is</EMPH> the East?&rdquo; said Jane, dancing about
in her agony of terror.</P>
<P>Nobody knew. So they opened the fish&hyphen;bag to ask the Psammead.</P>
<P>And the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it.</P>
<P>The Psammead was gone.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hide the sacred thing! Hide it! Hide it!&rdquo; whispered the
girl.</P>
<P>Cyril shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look as brave as he knew he
ought to feel.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hide it up, Pussy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are in for it now.
We&rsquo;ve just <EMPH>got</EMPH> to stay and see it out.&rdquo;</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE FIGHT IN THE VILLAGE</HEAD>
<P><HI>HERE</HI> was a horrible position! Four English children, whose
proper date was A.D. 1905, and whose proper address was London, set down in
Egypt in the year 6000 B.C., with no means whatever of getting back into
their own time and place. They could not find the East, and the sun was of
no use at the moment, because some officious person had once explained to
Cyril that the sun did not really set in the West at all&mdash;nor rise in
the East either, for the matter of that.</P>
<P>The Psammead had crept out of the bass&hyphen;bag when they were not
looking and had basely deserted them.</P>
<P>An enemy was approaching. There would be a fight. People get killed in
fights, and the idea of taking part in a fight was one that did not smile
to the children.</P>
<P>The man who had brought the news of the enemy still lay panting on the
sand. His tongue was hanging out, long and red, like a dog&rsquo;s. The
people of the village were hur&hyphen;
<PB ID="p98" N="98">
riedly filling the gaps in the fence with thorn&hyphen;bushes from the heap
that seemed to have been piled there ready for just such a need. They
lifted the clustering thorns with long poles&mdash;much as men at home,
nowadays, lift hay with a fork.</P>
<P>Jane bit her lip and tried to decide not to cry.</P>
<P>Robert felt in his pocket for a toy pistol and loaded it with a pink
paper cap. It was his only weapon.</P>
<P>Cyril tightened his belt two holes.</P>
<P>And Anthea absently took the drooping red roses from the buttonholes of
the others, bit the ends of the stalks, and set them in a pot of water that
stood in the shadow by a hut door. She was always rather silly about
flowers.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think perhaps the Psammead
is really arranging something for us. I don&rsquo;t believe it would go
away and leave us all alone in the Past. I&rsquo;m certain it
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane succeeded in deciding not to cry&mdash;at any rate yet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what can we do?&rdquo; Robert asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Cyril answered promptly, &ldquo;except keep our
eyes and ears open. Look! That runner chap&rsquo;s getting his wind.
Let&rsquo;s go and hear what he&rsquo;s got to say.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The runner had risen to his knees and was sitting back on his heels. Now
he stood up and spoke. He began by some respectful
<PB ID="p99" N="99">
remarks addressed to the heads of the village. His speech got more
interesting when he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I went out in my raft to snare ibises, and I had gone up the
stream an hour&rsquo;s journey. Then I set my snares and waited. And I
heard the sound of many wings, and looking up, saw many herons circling in
the air. And I saw that they were afraid; so I took thought. A beast may
scare one heron, coming upon it suddenly, but no beast will scare a whole
flock of herons. And still they flew and circled, and would not alight. So
then I knew that what scared the herons must be men, and men who knew not
our ways of going softly so as to take the birds and beasts unawares. By
this I knew they were not of our race or of our place. So, leaving my raft,
I crept along the river bank, and at last came upon the strangers. They are
many as the sands of the desert, and their spear&hyphen;heads shine red
like the sun. They are a terrible people, and their march is towards us.
Having seen this, I ran, and did not stay till I was before you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;These are <EMPH>your</EMPH> folk,&rdquo; said the headman,
turning suddenly and angrily on Cyril, &ldquo;you came as spies for
them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We did <EMPH>not</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril indignantly. &ldquo;We
wouldn&rsquo;t be spies for anything. I&rsquo;m certain these people
aren&rsquo;t a bit like us. Are they now?&rdquo; he asked the runner.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;these men&rsquo;s faces were
darkened, and their hair black as night.
<PB ID="p100" N="100">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet100"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p101" N="101">
Yet these strange children, maybe, are their gods, who have come before to
make ready the way for them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>A murmur ran through the crowd.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, <EMPH>no</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril again. &ldquo;We are on
your side. We will help you to guard your sacred things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The headman seemed impressed by the fact that Cyril knew that there
<EMPH>were</EMPH> sacred things to be guarded. He stood a moment gazing at
the children. Then he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is well. And now let all make offering, that we may be strong
in battle.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The crowd dispersed, and nine men, wearing antelope&hyphen;skins,
grouped themselves in front of the opening in the hedge in the middle of
the village. And presently, one by one, the men brought all sorts of
things&mdash;hippopotamus flesh, ostrich&hyphen;feathers, the fruit of the
date palms, red chalk, green chalk, fish from the river, and ibex from the
mountains; and the headman received these gifts. There was another hedge
inside the first, about a yard from it, so that there was a lane inside
between the hedges. And every now and then one of the headmen would
disappear along this lane with full hands and come back with hands
empty.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re making offerings to their Amulet,&rdquo; said
Anthea. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better give something too.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The pockets of the party, hastily explored, yielded a piece of pink
tape, a bit of sealing&hyphen;
<PB ID="p102" N="102">
wax, and part of the Waterbury watch that Robert had not been able to help
taking to pieces at Christmas and had never had time to rearrange. Most
boys have a watch in this condition.</P>
<P>They presented their offerings, and Anthea added the red roses.</P>
<P>The headman who took the things looked at them with awe, especially at
the red roses and the Waterbury&hyphen;watch fragment.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This is a day of very wondrous happenings,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I have no more room in me to be astonished. Our maiden said there
was peace between you and us. But for this coming of a foe we should have
made sure.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children shuddered.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now speak. Are you upon our side?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Yes</EMPH>. Don&rsquo;t I keep telling you we are?&rdquo;
Robert said. &ldquo;Look here. I will give you a sign. You see this.&rdquo;
He held out the toy pistol. &ldquo;I shall speak to it, and if it answers
me you will know that I and the others are come to guard your sacred
thing&mdash;that we&rsquo;ve just made the offerings to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Will that god whose image you hold in your hand speak to you
alone, or shall I also hear it?&rdquo; asked the man cautiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised when you <EMPH>do</EMPH> hear
it,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Now, then.&rdquo; He looked at the pistol
and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If we are to guard the sacred treasure within&rdquo;&mdash;he
pointed to the hedged&hyphen;in space&mdash;&ldquo;speak with thy loud
voice, and we shall obey.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p103" N="103">
<P>He pulled the trigger, and the cap went off. The noise was loud, for it
was a two&hyphen;shilling pistol, and the caps were excellent.</P>
<P>Every man, woman, and child in the village fell on its face on the
sand.</P>
<P>The headman who had accepted the test rose first.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The voice has spoken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lead them into the
ante&hyphen;room of the sacred thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So now the four children were led in through the opening of the hedge
and round the lane till they came to an opening in the inner hedge, and
they went through an opening in that, and so passed into another lane.</P>
<P>The thing was built something like this, and all the hedges were of
brushwood and thorns&colon;
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet103"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p104" N="104">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet104"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p105" N="105">
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the maze at Hampton Court,&rdquo; whispered
Anthea.</P>
<P>The lanes were all open to the sky, but the little hut in the middle of
the maze was round&hyphen;roofed, and a curtain of skins hung over the
doorway.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here you may wait,&rdquo; said their guide, &ldquo;but do not
dare to pass the curtain.&rdquo; He himself passed it and disappeared.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; whispered Cyril, &ldquo;some of us ought to
be outside, in case the Psammead turns up.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s get separated from each other, whatever
we do,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite bad enough to be
separated from the Psammead. We can&rsquo;t do anything while that man is
in there. Let&rsquo;s all go out into the village again. We can come back
later now we know the way in. That man&rsquo;ll have to fight like the
rest, most likely, if it comes to fighting. If we find the Psammead
we&rsquo;ll go straight home. It must be getting late, and I don&rsquo;t
much like this mazy place.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They went out and told the headman that they would protect the treasure
when the fighting began. And now they looked about them and were able to
see exactly how a first&hyphen;class worker in flint flakes and notches an
arrow&hyphen;head or the edge of an axe&mdash;an advantage which no other
person now alive has ever enjoyed. The boys found the weapons most
interesting. The arrow&hyphen;heads were not on arrows such as you shoot
from
<PB ID="p106" N="106">
a bow, but on javelins, for throwing from the hand. The chief weapon was a
stone fastened to a rather short stick something like the things gentlemen
used to carry about and call life&hyphen;preservers in the days of the
garrotters. Then there were long things like spears or lances, with flint
heads to them, and there were flint knives&mdash;horribly sharp&mdash;and
flint battle&hyphen;axes.</P>
<P>Everyone in the village was so busy that the place was like an
ant&hyphen;heap when you have walked into it by accident. The women were
busy and even the children.</P>
<P>Quite suddenly all the air seemed to glow and grow red&mdash;it was like
the sudden opening of a furnace door, such as you may see at Woolwich
Arsenal if you ever have the luck to be taken there&mdash;and then almost
as suddenly it was as though the furnace doors had been shut. For the sun
had set, and it was night.</P>
<P>The sun had that abrupt way of setting in Egypt eight thousand years
ago, and I believe it has never been able to break itself of the habit, and
sets in exactly the same manner to the present day. The girl brought the
skins of wild deer and led the children to a heap of dry sedge.</P>
<P>&ldquo;My father says they will not attack yet. Sleep!&rdquo; she said,
and it really seemed a good idea. You may think that in the midst of all
these dangers the children would not have been able to sleep&mdash;but
somehow, though they were rather frightened now and then,
<PB ID="p107" N="107">
the feeling was growing in them&mdash;deep down and almost hidden away, but
still growing&mdash;that the Psammead was to be trusted, and that they were
really and truly safe. This did not prevent their being quite as much
frightened as they could bear to be without being perfectly miserable.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better go to sleep,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what on earth poor old Nurse will do with us out
all night; set the police on our tracks, I expect. I only wish they could
find us! A dozen policemen would be rather welcome just now. But it&rsquo;s
no use getting into a stew over it,&rdquo; he added soothingly. &ldquo;Good
night.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And they all fell asleep.</P>
<P>They were awakened by long, loud, terrible sounds that seemed to come
from everywhere at once&mdash;horrible threatening shouts and shrieks and
howls that sounded, as Cyril said later, like the voices of men thirsting
for their enemies&rsquo; blood.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is the voice of the strange men,&rdquo; said the girl, coming
to them trembling through the dark. &ldquo;They have attacked the walls,
and the thorns have driven them back. My father says they will not try
again till daylight. But they are shouting to frighten us. As though we
were savages! dwellers in the swamps!&rdquo; she said indignantly.</P>
<P>All night the terrible noise went on, but when the sun rose, as abruptly
as he had set, the sound suddenly ceased.</P>
<PB ID="p108" N="108">
<P>The children had hardly time to be glad of this before a shower of
javelins came hurtling over the great thorn&hyphen;hedge, and everyone
sheltered behind the huts. But next moment another shower of weapons came
from the opposite side, and the crowd rushed to other shelter. Cyril pulled
out a javelin that had stuck in the roof of the hut beside him. Its head
was of brightly burnished copper.</P>
<P>Then the sound of shouting arose again and the crackle of dried thorns.
The enemy was breaking down the hedge. All the villagers swarmed to the
point whence the crackling and the shouting came; they hurled stones over
the hedges, and short arrows with flint heads. The children had never
before seen men with the fighting light in their eyes. It was very strange
and terrible, and gave you a queer thick feeling in your throat; it was
quite different from the pictures of fights in the illustrated papers at
home.</P>
<P>It seemed that the shower of stones had driven back the besiegers. The
besieged drew breath, but at that moment the shouting and the crackling
arose on the opposite side of the village and the crowd hastened to defend
that point, and so the fight swayed to and fro across the village, for the
besieged had not the sense to divide their forces as their enemies had
done.</P>
<P>Cyril noticed that every now and then certain of the fighting&hyphen;men
would enter the maze, and come out with brighter
<PB ID="p109" N="109">
faces, a braver aspect, and a more upright carriage.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I believe they go and touch the Amulet,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You know the Psammead said it could make people brave.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They crept through the maze, and watching they saw that Cyril was right.
A headman was standing in front of the skin curtain, and as the warriors
came before him he murmured a word they could not hear, and touched their
foreheads with something that they could not see. And this something he
held in his hands. And through his fingers they saw the gleam of a red
stone that they knew.</P>
<P>The fight raged across the thorn&hyphen;hedge outside. Suddenly there
was a loud and bitter cry.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in! They&rsquo;re in! The hedge is down!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The headman disappeared behind the deer&hyphen;skin curtain.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to hide it,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Oh,
Psammead dear, how could you leave us!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Suddenly there was a shriek from inside the hut, and the headman
staggered out white with fear and fled out through the maze. The children
were as white as he.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! what is it? what is it?&rdquo; moaned Anthea. &ldquo;Oh,
Psammead, how could you! how could you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And the sound of the fight sank breathlessly, and swelled fiercely all
around. It was like the rising and falling of the waves of the sea.</P>
<PB ID="p110" N="110">
<P>Anthea shuddered and said again, &ldquo;Oh, Psammead,
Psammead!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said a brisk voice, and the curtain of skins was
lifted at one corner by a furry hand, and out peeped the bat&rsquo;s ears
and snail&rsquo;s eyes of the Psammead.</P>
<P>Anthea caught it in her arms and a sigh of desperate relief was breathed
by each of the four.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! which <EMPH>is</EMPH> the East!&rdquo; Anthea said, and she
spoke hurriedly, for the noise of wild fighting drew nearer and nearer.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t choke me,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;come
inside.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The inside of the hut was pitch dark.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a match,&rdquo; said Cyril, and struck it. The
floor of the hut was of soft, loose sand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep here,&rdquo; said the Psammead;
&ldquo;most comfortable it&rsquo;s been, the best sand I&rsquo;ve had for a
month. It&rsquo;s all right. Everything&rsquo;s all right. I knew your only
chance would be while the fight was going on. That man won&rsquo;t come
back. I bit him, and he thinks I&rsquo;m an Evil Spirit. Now you&rsquo;ve
only got to take the thing and go.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The hut was hung with skins. Heaped in the middle were the offerings
that had been given the night before, Anthea&rsquo;s roses fading on the
top of the heap. At one side of the hut stood a large square stone block,
and on it an oblong box of earthenware with strange figures of men and
beasts on it.</P>
<PB ID="p111" N="111">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet111"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p112" N="112">
<P>&ldquo;Is the thing in there?&rdquo; asked Cyril, as the Psammead
pointed a skinny finger at it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You must judge of that,&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;The man
was just going to bury the box in the sand when I jumped out at him and bit
him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Light another match, Robert,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Now, then
quick! which is the East?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, where the sun rises, of course!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But someone told us&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ll tell you anything!&rdquo; said the Psammead
impatiently, getting into its bass&hyphen;bag and wrapping itself in its
waterproof sheet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t see the sun in here, and it isn&rsquo;t rising
anyhow,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How you do waste time!&rdquo; the Psammead said. &ldquo;Why, the
East&rsquo;s where the shrine is, of course. <EMPH>There</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<P>It pointed to the great stone.</P>
<P>And still the shouting and the clash of stone on metal sounded nearer
and nearer. The children could hear that the headmen had surrounded the hut
to protect their treasure as long as might be from the enemy. But none
dared to come in after the Psammead&rsquo;s sudden fierce biting of the
headman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now, Jane,&rdquo; said Cyril, very quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take the Amulet, you stand ready to hold up the charm, and be sure you
don&rsquo;t let it go as you come through.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He made a step forward, but at that instant
<PB ID="p113" N="113">
a great crackling overhead ended in a blaze of sunlight. The roof had been
broken in at one side, and great slabs of it were being lifted off by two
spears. As the children trembled and winked in the new light, large dark
hands tore down the wall, and a dark face, with a blobby fat nose, looked
over the gap. Even at that awful moment Anthea had time to think that it
was very like the face of Mr Jacob Absalom, who had sold them the charm in
the shop near Charing Cross.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here is their Amulet,&rdquo; cried a harsh, strange voice;
&ldquo;it is this that makes them strong to fight and brave to die. And
what else have we here&mdash;gods or demons?&rdquo;</P>
<P>He glared fiercely at the children, and the whites of his eyes were very
white indeed. He had a wet, red copper knife in his teeth. There was not a
moment to lose.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jane, <EMPH>Jane</EMPH>, QUICK!&rdquo; cried every one
passionately.</P>
<P>Jane with trembling hands held up the charm towards the East, and Cyril
spoke the word of power. The Amulet grew to a great arch. Out beyond it was
the glaring Egyptian sky, the broken wall, the cruel, dark,
big&hyphen;nosed face with the red, wet knife in its gleaming teeth. Within
the arch was the dull, faint, greeny&hyphen;brown of London grass and
trees.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hold tight, Jane!&rdquo; Cyril cried, and he dashed through the
arch, dragging Anthea
<PB ID="p114" N="114">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet114"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p115" N="115">
and the Psammead after him. Robert followed, clutching Jane. And in the
ears of each, as they passed through the arch of the charm, the sound and
fury of battle died out suddenly and utterly, and they heard only the low,
dull, discontented hum of vast London, and the peeking and patting of the
sparrows on the gravel and the voices of the ragged baby children playing
Ring&hyphen;o&rsquo;&hyphen;Roses on the yellow trampled grass. And the
charm was a little charm again in Jane&rsquo;s hand, and there was the
basket with their dinner and the bath&hyphen;buns lying just where they had
left it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;My hat!&rdquo; said Cyril, drawing a long breath; &ldquo;that was
something like an adventure.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It was rather like one, certainly,&rdquo; said the Psammead.</P>
<P>They all lay still, breathing in the safe, quiet air of Regent&rsquo;s
Park.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go home at once,&rdquo; said Anthea presently.
&ldquo;Old Nurse will be most frightfully anxious. The sun looks about the
same as it did when we started yesterday. We&rsquo;ve been away
twenty&hyphen;four hours.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The buns are quite soft still,&rdquo; said Cyril, feeling one;
&ldquo;I suppose the dew kept them fresh.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They were not hungry, curiously enough.</P>
<P>They picked up the dinner&hyphen;basket and the Psammead&hyphen;basket,
and went straight home.</P>
<P>Old Nurse met them with amazement.</P>
<PB ID="p116" N="116">
<P>&ldquo;Well, if ever I did!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone
wrong? You&rsquo;ve soon tired of your picnic.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children took this to be bitter irony, which means saying the exact
opposite of what you mean in order to make yourself disagreeable; as when
you happen to have a dirty face, and someone says, &ldquo;How nice and
clean you look!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry,&rdquo; began Anthea, but old Nurse
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, bless me, child, I don&rsquo;t care! Please yourselves and
you&rsquo;ll please me. Come in and get your dinners comf&rsquo;table.
I&rsquo;ve got a potato on a&hyphen;boiling.&rdquo;</P>
<P>When she had gone to attend to the potatoes the children looked at each
other. Could it be that old Nurse had so changed that she no longer cared
that they should have been away from home for twenty&hyphen;four
hours&mdash;all night in fact&mdash;without any explanation whatever?</P>
<P>But the Psammead put its head out of its basket and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Don&rsquo;t you understand? You come
back through the charm&hyphen;arch at the same time as you go through it.
This isn&rsquo;t tomorrow!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is it still yesterday?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s today. The same as it&rsquo;s always been. It
wouldn&rsquo;t do to go mixing up the present and the Past, and cutting
bits out of one to fit into the other.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p117" N="117">
<P>&ldquo;Then all that adventure took no time at all?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can call it that if you like,&rdquo; said the Psammead.
&ldquo;It took none of the modern time, anyhow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>That evening Anthea carried up a steak for the learned gentleman&rsquo;s
dinner. She persuaded Beatrice, the maid&hyphen;of&hyphen;all&hyphen;work,
who had given her the bangle with the blue stone, to let her do it. And she
stayed and talked to him, by special invitation, while he ate the
dinner.</P>
<P>She told him the whole adventure, beginning with&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;This afternoon we found ourselves on the bank of the River
Nile,&rdquo; and ending up with, &ldquo;And then we remembered how to get
back, and there we were in Regent&rsquo;s Park, and it hadn&rsquo;t taken
any time at all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She did not tell anything about the charm or the Psammead, because that
was forbidden, but the story was quite wonderful enough even as it was to
entrance the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You are a most unusual little girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who
tells you all these things?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;they just happen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Make&hyphen;believe,&rdquo; he said slowly, as one who recalls
and pronounces a long&hyphen;forgotten word.</P>
<P>He sat long after she had left him. At last he roused himself with a
start.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I really must take a holiday,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my nerves
must be all out of order. I
<PB ID="p118" N="118">
actually have a perfectly distinct impression that the little girl from the
rooms below came in and gave me a coherent and graphic picture of life as I
conceive it to have been in pre&hyphen;dynastic Egypt. Strange what tricks
the mind will play! I shall have to be more careful.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He finished his bread conscientiously, and actually went for a mile walk
before he went back to his work.</P>

<P><HI>JANE</HI> was singing to her doll, rocking it to and fro in the
house which she had made for herself and it. The roof of the house was the
dining&hyphen;table, and the walls were tablecloths and antimacassars
hanging all round, and kept in their places by books laid on their top ends
at the table edge.</P>
<P>The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic toboganning. You
know how it is done&mdash;with the largest and best tea&hyphen;tray and the
surface of the stair carpet. It is best to do it on the days when the stair
rods are being cleaned, and the carpet is only held by the nails at the
top. Of course, it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip&hyphen;top
games that grown&hyphen;up people are so unjust to&mdash;and old Nurse,
though a brick in many respects, was
<PB ID="p120" N="120">
quite enough of a standard grown&hyphen;up to put her foot down on the
toboganning long before any of the performers had had half enough of it.
The tea&hyphen; tray was taken away, and the baffled party entered the
sitting&hyphen;room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they could
help it.</P>
<P>So Cyril said, &ldquo;What a beastly mess!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And Robert added, &ldquo;Do shut up, Jane!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Even Anthea, who was almost always kind, advised Jane to try another
song. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick to death of that,&rdquo; said she.</P>
<P>It was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of
London that can be seen for nothing, could be carried out. Everyone had
been thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day
before, when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch,
through which they had walked straight out of the present time and the
Regent&rsquo;s Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago. The
memory of yesterday&rsquo;s happenings was still extremely fresh and
frightening, so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another
excursion into the past, for it seemed to all that yesterday&rsquo;s
adventures were quite enough to last for at least a week. Yet each felt a
little anxious that the others should not think it was afraid, and
presently Cyril, who really was not a coward, began to see that it would
not be at all nice if he should have to think himself one. So he
said&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p121" N="121">
<P>&ldquo;I say&mdash;about that charm&mdash;Jane&mdash;come out. We ought
to talk about it, anyhow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>Jane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there.</P>
<P>She felt for the charm, to make sure that it was still round her
neck.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>isn&rsquo;t</EMPH> all,&rdquo; said Cyril, saying much
more than he meant because he thought Robert&rsquo;s tone had been
rude&mdash;as indeed it had. &ldquo;We ought to go and look for that
Amulet. What&rsquo;s the good of having a first&hyphen;class charm and
keeping it idle, just eating its head off in the stable.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I&rsquo;m</EMPH> game for anything, of course,&rdquo; said
Robert; but he added, with a fine air of chivalry, &ldquo;only I
don&rsquo;t think the girls are keen today somehow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I am,&rdquo; said Anthea hurriedly. &ldquo;If you think
I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I am though,&rdquo; said Jane heavily; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like
it, and I won&rsquo;t go there again&mdash;not for anything I
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t go <EMPH>there</EMPH> again, silly,&rdquo;
said Cyril; &ldquo;it would be some other place.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I daresay; a place with lions and tigers in it as likely as
not.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Seeing Jane so frightened, made the others feel quite brave. They said
they were certain they ought to go.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so ungrateful to the Psammead not to,&rdquo; Anthea
added, a little primly.</P>
<P>Jane stood up. She was desperate.</P>
<PB ID="p122" N="122">
<P>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I
won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t! If you make me I&rsquo;ll scream and I&rsquo;ll
scream, and I&rsquo;ll tell old Nurse, and I&rsquo;ll get her to burn the
charm in the kitchen fire. So now, then!&rdquo;</P>
<P>You can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling what each
of them had felt all the morning. In each breast the same thought arose,
&ldquo;No one can say it&rsquo;s <EMPH>our</EMPH> fault.&rdquo; And they at
once began to show Jane how angry they all felt that all the fault was
hers. This made them feel quite brave.</P>
<P><Q><L>&ldquo;Tell&hyphen;tale tit, its tongue shall be split,</L><L>And
all the dogs in our town shall have a little bit,&rdquo;</L></Q> sang
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the way if you have girls in anything.&rdquo;
Cyril spoke in a cold displeasure that was worse than Robert&rsquo;s cruel
quotation, and even Anthea said, &ldquo;Well, <EMPH>I&rsquo;m</EMPH> not
afraid if I <EMPH>am</EMPH> a girl,&rdquo; which of course, was the most
cutting thing of all.</P>
<P>Jane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is sometimes
called the courage of despair.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
<EMPH>won&rsquo;t</EMPH>, so there! It&rsquo;s just silly going to places
when you don&rsquo;t want to, and when you don&rsquo;t know what
they&rsquo;re going to be like! You can laugh at me as much as you like.
You&rsquo;re beasts&mdash;and I hate you all!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p123" N="123">
<P>With these awful words she went out and banged the door.</P>
<P>Then the others would not look at each other, and they did not feel so
brave as they had done.</P>
<P>Cyril took up a book, but it was not interesting to read. Robert kicked
a chair&hyphen;leg absently. His feet were always eloquent in moments of
emotion. Anthea stood pleating the end of the table&hyphen;cloth into
folds&mdash;she seemed earnestly anxious to get all the pleats the same
size. The sound of Jane&rsquo;s sobs had died away.</P>
<P>Suddenly Anthea said, &ldquo;Oh! let it be &lsquo;pax&rsquo;&mdash;poor
little Pussy&mdash;you know she&rsquo;s the youngest.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She called us beasts,&rdquo; said Robert, kicking the chair
suddenly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, said Cyril, who was subject to passing fits of justice,
&ldquo;we began, you know. At least you did.&rdquo; Cyril&rsquo;s justice
was always uncompromising.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say I&rsquo;m sorry if you mean
that,&rdquo; said Robert, and the chair&hyphen;leg cracked to the kick he
gave as he said it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, do let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re three
to one, and Mother does so hate it if we row. Come on. I&rsquo;ll say
I&rsquo;m sorry first, though I didn&rsquo;t say anything,
hardly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s get it over,&rdquo; said Cyril, opening
the door.&ldquo;Hi&mdash;you&mdash;Pussy!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p124" N="124">
<P>Far away up the stairs a voice could be heard singing brokenly, but
still defiantly&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&ldquo;How many miles (sniff) to Babylon?</L><L REND="indent1">Three
score and ten (sniff),</L><L>Can I get there by candle
light?</L><L REND="indent1">Yes (sniff), and back again!&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>It was trying, for this was plainly meant to annoy. But Anthea would not
give herself time to think this. She led the way up the stairs, taking
three at a time, and bounded to the level of Jane, who sat on the top step
of all, thumping her doll to the tune of the song she was trying to
sing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say, Pussy, let it be pax! We&rsquo;re sorry if you
are&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was enough. The kiss of peace was given by all. Jane being the
youngest was entitled to this ceremonial.</P>
<P>Anthea added a special apology of her own.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was a pig, Pussy dear,&rdquo; she
said&mdash;&ldquo;especially because in my really and truly inside mind
I&rsquo;ve been feeling a little as if I&rsquo;d rather not go into the
Past again either. But then, do think. If we don&rsquo;t go we shan&rsquo;t
get the Amulet, and oh, Pussy, think if we could only get Father and Mother
and The Lamb safe back! We <EMPH>must</EMPH> go, but we&rsquo;ll wait a day
or two if you like and then perhaps you&rsquo;ll feel braver.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Raw meat makes you brave, however cowardly you are,&rdquo; said
Robert, to show
<PB ID="p125" N="125">
that there was now no ill&hyphen;feeling, &ldquo;and
cranberries&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Tartars eat, and they&rsquo;re so brave
it&rsquo;s simply awful. I suppose cranberries are only for Christmas time,
but I&rsquo;ll ask old Nurse to let you have your chop very raw if you
like.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I think I could be brave without that,&rdquo; said Jane hastily;
she hated underdone meat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At this moment the door of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s room opened,
and he looked out.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of
his, &ldquo;but was I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word
just now? Were you not singing some old ballad of Babylon?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;at least Jane was singing
&lsquo;How many miles,&rsquo; but I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you could
have heard the words for&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>He would have said, &ldquo;for the sniffing,&rdquo; but Anthea pinched
him just in time.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I did not hear <EMPH>all</EMPH> the words,&rdquo; said the
learned gentleman. &ldquo;I wonder would you recite them to me?&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they all said together&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&ldquo;How many miles to Babylon?</L><L REND="indent1">Three score
and ten!</L><L>Can I get there by candle light?</L><L REND="indent1">Yes,
and back again!&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>&ldquo;I wish one could,&rdquo; the learned gentleman said with a
sigh.</P>
<PB ID="p126" N="126">
<P>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Babylon has fallen,&rdquo; he answered with a sigh. &ldquo;You
know it was once a great and beautiful city, and the centre of learning and
Art, and now it is only ruins, and so covered up with earth that people are
not even agreed as to where it once stood.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He was leaning on the banisters, and his eyes had a far&hyphen;away look
in them, as though he could see through the staircase&hyphen;window the
splendour and glory of ancient Babylon.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Cyril remarked abruptly. &ldquo;You know that charm
we showed you, and you told us how to say the name that&rsquo;s on
it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, do you think that charm was ever in Babylon?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible,&rdquo; the learned gentleman replied.
&ldquo;such charms have been found in very early Egyptian tombs, yet their
origin has not been accurately determined as Egyptian. They may have been
brought from Asia. Or, supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt,
it might very well have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy,
or brought back by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part
of the spoils of war. The inscription may be much later than the charm. Oh
yes! it is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours was once
used amid Babylonish surroundings.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p127" N="127">
<P>The others looked at each other, but it was Jane who spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Were the Babylon people savages, were they always fighting and
throwing things about?&rdquo; For she had read the thoughts of the others
by the unerring light of her own fears.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the
Assyrians,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman. &ldquo;And they were not
savages by any means. A very high level of culture,&rdquo; he looked
doubtfully at his audience and went on, &ldquo;I mean that they made
beautiful statues and jewellery, and built splendid palaces. And they were
very learned&hyphen; they had glorious libraries and high towers for the
purpose of astrological and astronomical observation.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Er?&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I mean for&mdash;star&hyphen;gazing and
fortune&hyphen;telling,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, &ldquo;and there
were temples and beautiful hanging gardens&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Babylon if you like,&rdquo; said Jane abruptly,
and the others hastened to say &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; before she should have
time to change her mind.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly,
&ldquo;one can go so far in dreams, when one is young.&rdquo; He sighed
again, and then adding with a laboured briskness, &ldquo;I hope
you&rsquo;ll have a&mdash;a&mdash;jolly game,&rdquo; he went into his room
and shut the door.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He said &lsquo;jolly&rsquo; as if it was a foreign
<PB ID="p128" N="128">
language,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get the Psammead
and go now. I think Babylon seems a most frightfully jolly place to go
to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they woke the Psammead and put it in its bass&hyphen;bag with the
waterproof sheet, in case of inclement weather in Babylon. It was very
cross, but it said it would as soon go to Babylon as anywhere else.
&ldquo;The sand is good thereabouts,&rdquo; it added.</P>
<P>Then Jane held up the charm, and Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was
lost. Will you please let us go there through you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Please put us down just outside,&rdquo; said Jane hastily;
&ldquo;and then if we don&rsquo;t like it we needn&rsquo;t go
inside.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be all day,&rdquo; said the Psammead.</P>
<P>So Anthea hastily uttered the word of power, without which the charm
could do nothing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ur&mdash;hekau&mdash;setcheh!&rdquo; she said softly, and as she
spoke the charm grew into an arch so tall that the top of it was close
against the bedroom ceiling. Outside the arch was the bedroom painted
chest&hyphen;of&hyphen;drawers and the Kidderminster carpet, and the
washhand&hyphen;stand with the riveted willow&hyphen;pattern jug, and the
faded curtains, and the dull light of indoors on a wet day. Through the
arch showed the gleam of soft green leaves and white blossoms. They stepped
forward quite
<PB ID="p129" N="129">
happily. Even Jane felt that this did not look like lions, and her hand
hardly trembled at all as she held the charm for the others to go through,
and last, slipped through herself, and hung the charm, now grown small
again, round her neck.</P>
<P>The children found themselves under a white&hyphen;blossomed,
green&hyphen;leafed fruit&hyphen;tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of
such trees, all white&hyphen;flowered and green&hyphen;foliaged. Among the
long green grass under their feet grew crocuses and lilies, and strange
blue flowers. In the branches overhead thrushes and blackbirds were
singing, and the coo of a pigeon came softly to them in the green quietness
of the orchard.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, how perfectly lovely!&rdquo; cried Anthea. &ldquo;Why,
it&rsquo;s like home exactly&mdash;I mean England&mdash;only
everything&rsquo;s bluer, and whiter, and greener, and the flowers are
bigger.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The boys owned that it certainly was fairly decent, and even Jane
admitted that it was all very pretty.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain there&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened of
here,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I suppose the
fruit&hyphen;trees go on just the same even when people are killing each
other. I didn&rsquo;t half like what the learned gentleman said about the
hanging gardens. I suppose they have gardens on purpose to hang people in.
I do hope this isn&rsquo;t one.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p130" N="130">
<P>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;The hanging
gardens are just gardens hung up&mdash;<EMPH>I</EMPH> think on chains
between houses, don&rsquo;t you know, like trays. Come on; let&rsquo;s get
somewhere.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They began to walk through the cool grass. As far as they could see was
nothing but trees, and trees, and more trees. At the end of their orchard
was another one, only separated from theirs by a little stream of clear
water. They jumped this, and went on. Cyril, who was fond of
gardening&mdash;which meant that he liked to watch the gardener at
work&mdash;was able to command the respect of the others by telling them
the names of a good many trees. There were nut&hyphen;trees and
almond&hyphen;trees, and apricots, and fig&hyphen;trees with their big
five&hyphen;fingered leaves. And every now and then the children had to
cross another brook.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like between the squares in &lsquo;Through the
Looking&hyphen;glass,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>At last they came to an orchard which was quite different from the other
orchards. It had a low building in one corner.</P>
<P>&ldquo;These are vines,&rdquo; said Cyril superiorly, &ldquo;and I know
this is a vineyard. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if there was a
wine&hyphen;press inside that place over there.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At last they got out of the orchards and on to a sort of road, very
rough, and not at all like the roads you are used to. It had
cypress&hyphen;trees and acacia&hyphen;trees along it, and
<PB ID="p131" N="131">
a sort of hedge of tamarisks, like those you see on the road between Nice
and Cannes, or near Littlehampton, if you&rsquo;ve only been as far as
that.</P>
<P>And now in front of them they could see a great mass of buildings. There
were scattered houses of wood and stone here and there among green
orchards, and beyond these a great wall that shone red in the early morning
sun. The wall was enormously high&mdash;more than half the height of St.
Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;and in the wall were set enormous gates that shone like
gold as the rising sun beat on them. Each gate had a solid square tower on
each side of it that stood out from the wall and rose above it. Beyond the
wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and bright colours.
Away to the left ran the steel&hyphen;blue swirl of a great river. And the
children could see, through a gap in the trees, that the river flowed out
from the town under a great arch in the wall.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Those feathery things along by the water are palms,&rdquo; said
Cyril instructively.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you know everything,&rdquo; Robert replied.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that grey&hyphen;green stuff you see away over
there, where it&rsquo;s all flat and sandy?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cyril loftily, &ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH>
don&rsquo;t want to tell you anything. I only thought you&rsquo;d like to
know a palm&hyphen;tree when you saw it again.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p132" N="132">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet132"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p133" N="133">
<P>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Anthea; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re opening the
gates.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And indeed the great gates swung back with a brazen clang, and instantly
a little crowd of a dozen or more people came out and along the road
towards them.</P>
<P>The children, with one accord, crouched behind the tamarisk hedge.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the sound of those gates,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;Fancy being inside when they shut. You&rsquo;d never get
out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got an arch of your own to go out by,&rdquo; the
Psammead put its head out of the basket to remind her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
behave so like a girl. If I were you I should just march right into the
town and ask to see the king.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was something at once simple and grand about this idea, and it
pleased everyone.</P>
<P>So when the work&hyphen;people had passed (they <EMPH>were</EMPH>
work&hyphen;people, the children felt sure, because they were dressed so
plainly&mdash;just one long blue shirt thing&mdash;of blue or yellow) the
four children marched boldly up to the brazen gate between the towers. The
arch above the gate was quite a tunnel, the walls were so thick.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;Step out. It&rsquo;s no use
trying to sneak past. Be bold!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert answered this appeal by unexpectedly bursting into &ldquo;The
British Grenadiers,&rdquo; and to its quick&hyphen;step they approached the
gates of Babylon.</P>
<PB ID="p134" N="134">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet134"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p135" N="135">
<Q><L>&ldquo;Some talk of Alexander,</L><L REND="indent1">And some of
Hercules,</L><L>Of Hector and Lysander,</L><L REND="indent1">And such great
names as these.</L><L>But of all the gallant heroes ...&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>This brought them to the threshold of the gate, and two men in bright
armour suddenly barred their way with crossed spears.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; they said.</P>
<P>(I think I must have explained to you before how it was that the
children were always able to understand the language of any place they
might happen to be in, and to be themselves understood. If not, I have no
time to explain it now.)</P>
<P>&ldquo;We come from very far,&rdquo; said Cyril mechanically.
&ldquo;From the Empire where the sun never sets, and we want to see your
King.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s quite convenient,&rdquo; amended Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The King (may he live for ever!),&rdquo; said the gatekeeper,
&ldquo;is gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife. Where on earth have you
come from not to know that?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Queen then,&rdquo; said Anthea hurriedly, and not taking any
notice of the question as to where they had come from.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Queen,&rdquo; said the gatekeeper, &ldquo;(may she live for
ever!) gives audience today three hours after sun&hyphen;rising.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what are we to do till the end of the three hours?&rdquo;
asked Cyril.</P>
<P>The gatekeeper seemed neither to know nor
<PB ID="p136" N="136">
to care. He appeared less interested in them than they could have thought
possible. But the man who had crossed spears with him to bar the
children&rsquo;s way was more human.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let them go in and look about them,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager my best sword they&rsquo;ve never seen anything to
come near our little&mdash;village.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He said it in the tone people use for when they call the Atlantic Ocean
the &ldquo;herring pond.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The gatekeeper hesitated.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re only children, after all,&rdquo; said the other,
who had children of his own. &ldquo;Let me off for a few minutes, Captain,
and I&rsquo;ll take them to my place and see if my good woman can&rsquo;t
fit them up in something a little less outlandish than their present rig.
Then they can have a look round without being mobbed. May I go?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes, if you like,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t be all day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The man led them through the dark arch into the town. And it was very
different from London. For one thing, everything in London seems to be
patched up out of odds and ends, but these houses seemed to have been built
by people who liked the same sort of things. Not that they were all alike,
for though all were squarish, they were of different sizes, and decorated
in all sorts of different ways, some with paintings in bright colours, some
with black and silver
<PB ID="p137" N="137">
designs. There were terraces, and gardens, and balconies, and open spaces
with trees. Their guide took them to a little house in a back street, where
a kind&hyphen;faced woman sat spinning at the door of a very dark room.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just lend these children a mantle
each, so that they can go about and see the place till the Queen&rsquo;s
audience begins. You leave that wool for a bit, and show them round if you
like. I must be off now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The woman did as she was told, and the four children, wrapped in fringed
mantles, went with her all about the town, and oh! how I wish I had time to
tell you all that they saw. It was all so wonderfully different from
anything you have ever seen. For one thing, all the houses were dazzlingly
bright, and many of them covered with pictures. Some had great creatures
carved in stone at each side of the door. Then the people&mdash;there were
no black frock&hyphen;coats and tall hats; no dingy coats and skirts of
good, useful, ugly stuffs warranted to wear. Everyone&rsquo;s clothes were
bright and beautiful with blue and scarlet and green and gold.</P>
<P>The market was brighter than you would think anything could be. There
were stalls for everything you could possibly want&mdash;and for a great
many things that if you wanted here and now, want would be your master.
There were pineapples and peaches in heaps&mdash;and stalls of crockery and
glass things,
<PB ID="p138" N="138">
beautiful shapes and glorious colours, there were stalls for necklaces, and
clasps, and bracelets, and brooches, for woven stuffs, and furs, and
embroidered linen. The children had never seen half so many beautiful
things together, even at Liberty&rsquo;s.</P>
<P>It seemed no time at all before the woman said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly time now. We ought to be getting on towards the
palace. It&rsquo;s as well to be early.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they went to the palace, and when they got there it was more splendid
than anything they had seen yet.</P>
<P>For it was glowing with colours, and with gold and silver and black and
white&mdash;like some magnificent embroidery. Flight after flight of broad
marble steps led up to it, and at the edges of the stairs stood great
images, twenty times as big as a man&mdash;images of men with wings like
chain armour, and hawks&rsquo; heads, and winged men with the heads of
dogs. And there were the statues of great kings.</P>
<P>Between the flights of steps were terraces where fountains played, and
the Queen&rsquo;s Guard in white and scarlet, and armour that shone like
gold, stood by twos lining the way up the stairs; and a great body of them
was massed by the vast door of the palace itself, where it stood glittering
like an impossibly radiant peacock in the noon&hyphen;day sun.</P>
<P>All sorts of people were passing up the
<PB ID="p139" N="139">
steps to seek audience of the Queen. Ladies in richly&hyphen;embroidered
dresses with fringy flounces, poor folks in plain and simple clothes,
dandies with beards oiled and curled.</P>
<P>And Cyril, Robert, Anthea and Jane, went with the crowd.</P>
<P>At the gate of the palace the Psammead put one eye cautiously out of the
basket and whispered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with queens. I&rsquo;ll go home with
this lady. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll get me some sand if you ask her
to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t leave us,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>The woman was giving some last instructions in Court etiquette to
Anthea, and did not hear Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a little muff,&rdquo; said the Psammead quite
fiercely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit of good your having a charm. You
never use it. If you want me you&rsquo;ve only got to say the name of power
and ask the charm to bring me to you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go with you,&rdquo; said Jane. And it was the
most surprising thing she had ever said in her life.</P>
<P>Every one opened its mouth without thinking of manners, and Anthea, who
was peeping into the Psammead&rsquo;s basket, saw that its mouth opened
wider than anybody&rsquo;s.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t gawp like that,&rdquo; Jane went on.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be bothered with queens any more than
<EMPH>it</EMPH> is. And I know, wherever it is, it&rsquo;ll take jolly good
care that it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p140" N="140">
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right there,&rdquo; said every one, for they had
observed that the Psammead had a way of knowing which side its bread was
buttered.</P>
<P>She turned to the woman and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take me home with
you, won&rsquo;t you? And let me play with your little girls till the
others have done with the Queen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Surely I will, little heart!&rdquo; said the woman.</P>
<P>And then Anthea hurriedly stroked the Psammead and embraced Jane, who
took the woman&rsquo;s hand, and trotted contentedly away with the
Psammead&rsquo;s bag under the other arm.</P>
<P>The others stood looking after her till she, the woman, and the basket
were lost in the many&hyphen;coloured crowd. Then Anthea turned once more
to the palace&rsquo;s magnificent doorway and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian
overcoats.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they took off the garments that the woman had lent them and stood
amid the jostling petitioners of the Queen in their own English frocks and
coats and hats and boots.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We want to see the Queen,&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;we come from
the far Empire where the sun never sets!&rdquo;</P>
<P>A murmur of surprise and a thrill of excitement ran through the crowd.
The door&hyphen;porter spoke to a black man, he spoke to someone else.
There was a whispering, waiting pause. Then a big man, with a
cleanly&hyphen;
<PB ID="p141" N="141">
shaven face, beckoned them from the top of a flight of red marble
steps.</P>
<P>They went up; the boots of Robert clattering more than usual because he
was so nervous. A door swung open, a curtain was drawn back. A double line
of bowing forms in gorgeous raiment formed a lane that led to the steps of
the throne, and as the children advanced hurriedly there came from the
throne a voice very sweet and kind.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Three children from the land where the sun never sets! Let them
draw hither without fear.&rdquo;</P>
<P>In another minute they were kneeling at the throne&rsquo;s foot, saying,
&ldquo;Oh, Queen, live for ever!&rdquo; exactly as the woman had taught
them. And a splendid dream&hyphen;lady, all gold and silver and jewels and
snowy drift of veils, was raising Anthea, and saying&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, I really am <EMPH>so</EMPH> glad you
came! The land where the sun never sets! I am delighted to see you! I was
getting quite too dreadfully bored for anything!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And behind Anthea the kneeling Cyril whispered in the ears of the
respectful Robert&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Bobs, don&rsquo;t say anything to Panther. It&rsquo;s no use
upsetting her, but we didn&rsquo;t ask for Jane&rsquo;s address, and the
Psammead&rsquo;s with her.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; whispered Robert, &ldquo;the charm can bring them to
us at any moment. <EMPH>It</EMPH> said so.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; whispered Cyril, in miserable
<PB ID="p142" N="142">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet142"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p143" N="143">
derision, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right, of course. So we are! Oh, yes! If
we&rsquo;d only <EMPH>got</EMPH> the charm.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then Robert saw, and he murmured, &ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; at the foot of
the throne of Babylon; while Cyril hoarsely whispered the plain English
fact&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jane&rsquo;s got the charm round her neck, you silly
cuckoo.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; Robert repeated in heart&hyphen;broken
undertones.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">&ldquo;THE DEEPEST DUNGEON BELOW THE CASTLE
MOAT&rdquo;</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Queen threw three of the red and gold embroidered cushions
off the throne on to the marble steps that led up to it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Just make yourselves comfortable there,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply dying to talk to you, and to hear all about your
wonderful country and how you got here, and everything, but I have to do
justice every morning. Such a bore, isn&rsquo;t it? Do you do justice in
your own country?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, said Cyril; &ldquo;at least of course we try to, but not in
this public sort of way, only in private.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I should much prefer a
private audience myself&mdash;much easier to manage. But public opinion has
to be considered. Doing justice is very hard work, even when you&rsquo;re
brought up to it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do justice, but we have to do scales, Jane and
me,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;twenty minutes a day. It&rsquo;s simply
horrid.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p145" N="145">
<P>&ldquo;What are scales?&rdquo; asked the Queen, &ldquo;and what is
Jane?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jane is my little sister. One of the
guards&hyphen;at&hyphen;the&hyphen;gate&rsquo;s wife is taking care of her.
And scales are music.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I never heard of the instrument,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Do
you sing?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes. We can sing in parts,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That <EMPH>is</EMPH> magic,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;How
many parts are you each cut into before you do it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t cut at all,&rdquo; said Robert hastily. &ldquo;We
couldn&rsquo;t sing if we were. We&rsquo;ll show you afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;So you shall, and now sit quiet like dear children and hear me do
justice. The way I do it has always been admired. I oughtn&rsquo;t to say
that ought I? Sounds so conceited. But I don&rsquo;t mind with you, dears.
Somehow I feel as though I&rsquo;d known you quite a long time
already.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her
attendants. The children, whispering together among the cushions on the
steps of the throne, decided that she was very beautiful and very kind, but
perhaps just the least bit flighty.</P>
<P>The first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose brother
had taken the money the father had left for her. The brother said it was
the uncle who had the money. There was a good deal of talk and
<PB ID="p146" N="146">
the children were growing rather bored, when the Queen suddenly clapped her
hands, and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Put both the men in prison till one of them owns up that the
other is innocent.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But suppose they both did it?&rdquo; Cyril could not help
interrupting.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then prison&rsquo;s the best place for them,&rdquo; said the
Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But suppose neither did it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;a
thing&rsquo;s not done unless some one does it. And you mustn&rsquo;t
interrupt.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then came a woman, in tears, with a torn veil and real ashes on her
head&mdash;at least Anthea thought so, but it may have been only
road&hyphen;dust. She complained that her husband was in prison.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They <EMPH>said</EMPH> it was for speaking evil of your
Majesty,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t. Some one had a
spite against him. That was what it was.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How do you know he hadn&rsquo;t spoken evil of me?&rdquo; said
the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No one could,&rdquo; said the woman simply, &ldquo;when
they&rsquo;d once seen your beautiful face.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let the man out,&rdquo; said the Queen, smiling. &ldquo;Next
case.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox. &ldquo;Like the
Spartan boy,&rdquo; whispered Robert. But the Queen ruled that nobody could
have any possible reason for
<PB ID="p147" N="147">
owning a fox, and still less for stealing one. And she did not believe that
there were any foxes in Babylon; she, at any rate, had never seen one. So
the boy was released.</P>
<P>The people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels and
neighbourly misunderstandings&mdash;from a fight between brothers over the
division of an inheritance, to the dishonest and unfriendly conduct of a
woman who had borrowed a cooking&hyphen;pot at the last New Year&rsquo;s
festival, and not returned it yet.</P>
<P>And the Queen decided everything, very, very decidedly indeed. At last
she clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme loudness, and
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The audience is over for today.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Every one said, &ldquo;May the Queen live for ever!&rdquo; and went
out.</P>
<P>And the children were left alone in the justice&hyphen;hall with the
Queen of Babylon and her ladies.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the Queen, with a long sigh of relief.
&ldquo;<EMPH>That&rsquo;s</EMPH> over! I couldn&rsquo;t have done another
stitch of justice if you&rsquo;d offered me the crown of Egypt! Now come
into the garden, and we&rsquo;ll have a nice, long, cosy talk.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She led them through long, narrow corridors whose walls they somehow
felt, were very, very thick, into a sort of garden courtyard. There were
thick shrubs closely planted, and roses were trained over trellises, and
made a
<PB ID="p148" N="148">
pleasant shade&mdash;needed, indeed, for already the sun was as hot as it
is in England in August at the seaside.</P>
<P>Slaves spread cushions on a low, marble terrace, and a big man with a
smooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with beryls. He drank
a little from the Queen&rsquo;s cup before handing it to her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a nasty trick,&rdquo; whispered Robert, who
had been carefully taught never to drink out of one of the nice, shiny,
metal cups that are chained to the London drinking fountains without first
rinsing it out thoroughly.</P>
<P>The Queen overheard him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Ritti&hyphen;Marduk is a very
clean man. And one has to have <EMPH>some one</EMPH> as taster, you know,
because of poison.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The word made the children feel rather creepy; but Ritti&hyphen;Marduk
had tasted all the cups, so they felt pretty safe. The drink was
delicious&mdash;very cold, and tasting like lemonade and partly like penny
ices.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Leave us,&rdquo; said the Queen. And all the Court ladies, in
their beautiful, many&hyphen;folded, many&hyphen;coloured, fringed dresses,
filed out slowly, and the children were left alone with the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell me all about
yourselves.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They looked at each other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You, Bobs,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No&mdash;Anthea,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<PB ID="p149" N="149">
<P>&ldquo;No&mdash;you&mdash;Cyril,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you remember how pleased the Queen of India was when you told her all about
us?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril muttered that it was all very well, and so it was. For when he had
told the tale of the Ph&oelig;nix and the Carpet to the Ranee, it had been
only the truth&mdash;and all the truth that he had to tell. But now it was
not easy to tell a convincing story without mentioning the
Amulet&mdash;which, of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t have done to
mention&mdash;and without owning that they were really living in London,
about two thousand five hundred years later than the time they were talking
in.</P>
<P>Cyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful power of
making wishes come true. The children had never been able to tell anyone
before, and Cyril was surprised to find that the spell which kept them
silent in London did not work here. &ldquo;something to do with our being
in the Past, I suppose,&rdquo; he said to himself.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This is <EMPH>most</EMPH> interesting,&rdquo; said the Queen.
&ldquo;We must have this Psammead for the banquet tonight. Its performance
will be one of the most popular turns in the whole programme. Where is
it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea explained that they did not know; also why it was that they did
not know.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> quite simple,&rdquo; said the
Queen, and every one breathed a deep sigh of relief as she said it.
&ldquo;Ritti&hyphen;Marduk shall
<PB ID="p150" N="150">
run down to the gates and find out which guard your sister went home
with.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Might he&rdquo;&mdash;Anthea&rsquo;s voice was
tremulous&mdash;&ldquo;might he&mdash;would it interfere with his
meal&hyphen;times, or anything like that, if he went
<EMPH>now</EMPH>?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course he shall go now. He may think himself lucky if he gets
his meals at any time,&rdquo; said the Queen heartily, and clapped her
hands.</P>
<P>&ldquo;May I send a letter?&rdquo; asked Cyril, pulling out a
red&hyphen;backed penny account&hyphen;book, and feeling in his pockets for
a stump of pencil that he <EMPH>knew</EMPH> was in one of them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;By all means. I&rsquo;ll call my scribe.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I can scribe right enough, thanks,&rdquo; said Cyril, finding
the pencil and licking its point. He even had to bite the wood a little,
for it was very blunt.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, you clever, clever boy!&rdquo; said the Queen.
&ldquo;<EMPH>Do</EMPH> let me watch you do it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril wrote on a leaf of the book&mdash;it was of rough, woolly paper,
with hairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had been
using one, and ruled for accounts.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hide <EMPH>it</EMPH> most carefully before you come here,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t mention it&mdash;and destroy this letter.
Everything is going A1. The Queen is a fair treat. There&rsquo;s nothing to
be afraid of.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What curious characters, and what a strange flat surface!&rdquo;
said the Queen. &ldquo;What have you inscribed?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p151" N="151">
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;scribed,&rdquo; replied Cyril cautiously,
&ldquo;that you are fair, and a&mdash;and like a&mdash;like a festival; and
that she need not be afraid, and that she is to come at once.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Ritti&hyphen;Marduk, who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril
wrote, his Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish head, now
took the letter, with some reluctance.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, Queen, live for ever! Is it a charm?&rdquo; he timidly asked.
&ldquo;A strong charm, most great lady?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Yes</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert, unexpectedly, &ldquo;it
<EMPH>is</EMPH> a charm, but it won&rsquo;t hurt anyone until you&rsquo;ve
given it to Jane. And then she&rsquo;ll destroy it, so that it
<EMPH>can&rsquo;t</EMPH> hurt anyone. It&rsquo;s most awful
strong!&mdash;as strong as&mdash;Peppermint!&rdquo; he ended abruptly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know not the god,&rdquo; said Ritti&hyphen;Marduk, bending
timorously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tear it up directly she gets it,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll end the charm. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid if you go
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Ritti&hyphen;Marduk went, seeming only partly satisfied; and then the
Queen began to admire the penny account&hyphen;book and the bit of pencil
in so marked and significant a way that Cyril felt he could not do less
than press them upon her as a gift. She ruffled the leaves delightedly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a wonderful substance!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And with this
style you make charms? Make a charm for me! Do you know,&rdquo; her
<PB ID="p152" N="152">
voice sank to a whisper, &ldquo;the names of the great ones of your own far
country?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; said Cyril, and hastily wrote the names of Alfred
the Great, Shakespeare, Nelson, Gordon, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr. Rudyard
Kipling, and Mr. Sherlock Holmes, while the Queen watched him with
&ldquo;unbaited breath,&rdquo; as Anthea said afterwards.</P>
<P>She took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of her
gown.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You shall teach me later to say the great names,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And the names of their Ministers&mdash;perhaps the great Nisroch is
one of them?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;Mr. Campbell
Bannerman&rsquo;s Prime Minister and Mr. Burns&rsquo; a Minister, and so is
the Archbishop of Canterbury, I think, but I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;and Dr.
Parker was one, I know, and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; said the Queen, putting her hands to her ears.
&ldquo;My head&rsquo;s going round with all those great names. You shall
teach them to me later&mdash;because of course you&rsquo;ll make us a nice
long visit now you <EMPH>have</EMPH> come, won&rsquo;t you? Now tell
me&mdash;but no, I am quite tired out with your being so clever. Besides,
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d like <EMPH>me</EMPH> to tell <EMPH>you</EMPH>
something, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;I want to know how it is that the
King has gone&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Excuse me, but you should say &lsquo;the King
may&hyphen;he&hyphen;live&hyphen;for&hyphen;ever,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the
Queen gently.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Anthea hastened
<PB ID="p153" N="153">
to say&mdash;&ldquo;the King
may&hyphen;he&hyphen;live&hyphen;for&hyphen;ever has gone to fetch home his
fourteenth wife? I don&rsquo;t think even Bluebeard had as many as that.
And, besides, he hasn&rsquo;t killed <EMPH>you</EMPH> at any
rate.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Queen looked bewildered.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She means,&rdquo; explained Robert, &ldquo;that English kings
only have one wife&mdash;at least, Henry the Eighth had seven or eight, but
not all at once.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In our country,&rdquo; said the Queen scornfully, &ldquo;a king
would not reign a day who had only one wife. No one would respect him, and
quite right too.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then are all the other thirteen alive?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course they are&mdash;poor mean&hyphen;spirited things! I
don&rsquo;t associate with them, of course, I am the Queen. They&rsquo;re
only the wives.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Anthea, gasping.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But oh, my dears,&rdquo; the Queen went on, &ldquo;such a
to&hyphen;do as there&rsquo;s been about this last wife! You never did! It
really was <EMPH>too</EMPH> funny. We wanted an Egyptian princess. The King
may&hyphen;he&hyphen;live&hyphen;for&hyphen;ever has got a wife from most
of the important nations, and he had set his heart on an Egyptian one to
complete his collection. Well, of course, to begin with, we sent a handsome
present of gold. The Egyptian king sent back some horses&mdash;quite a few;
he&rsquo;s fearfully stingy!&mdash;and he said he liked the gold very much,
but what
<PB ID="p154" N="154">
they were really short of was lapis lazuli, so of course we sent him some.
But by that time he&rsquo;d begun to use the gold to cover the beams of the
roof of the Temple of the Sun&hyphen;God, and he hadn&rsquo;t nearly enough
to finish the job, so we sent some more. And so it went on, oh, for years.
You see each journey takes at least six months. And at last we asked the
hand of his daughter in marriage.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, and then?&rdquo; said Anthea, who wanted to get to the
princess part of the story.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;when he&rsquo;d got
everything out of us that he could, and only given the meanest presents in
return, he sent to say he would esteem the honour of an alliance very
highly, only unfortunately he hadn&rsquo;t any daughter, but he hoped one
would be born soon, and if so, she should certainly be reserved for the
King of Babylon!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a trick!&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, wasn&rsquo;t it? So then we said his sister would do, and
then there were more gifts and more journeys; and now at last the tiresome,
black&hyphen;haired thing is coming, and the King
may&hyphen;he&hyphen;live&hyphen;for&hyphen;ever has gone seven days&rsquo;
journey to meet her at Carchemish. And he&rsquo;s gone in his best chariot,
the one inlaid with lapis lazuli and gold, with the gold&hyphen;plated
wheels and onyx&hyphen;studded hubs&mdash;much too great an honour in my
opinion. She&rsquo;ll be here tonight; there&rsquo;ll be a grand banquet to
celebrate her arrival. <EMPH>She</EMPH> won&rsquo;t be present, of course.
She&rsquo;ll be having her baths and her
<PB ID="p155" N="155">
anointings, and all that sort of thing. We always clean our foreign brides
very carefully. It takes two or three weeks. Now it&rsquo;s
dinner&hyphen;time, and you shall eat with me, for I can see that you are
of high rank.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She led them into a dark, cool hall, with many cushions on the floor. On
these they sat, and low tables were brought&mdash;beautiful tables of
smooth, blue stone mounted in gold. On these, golden trays were placed; but
there were no knives, or forks, or spoons. The children expected the Queen
to call for them; but no. She just ate with her fingers, and as the first
dish was a great tray of boiled corn, and meat and raisins all mixed up
together, and melted fat poured all over the tray, it was found difficult
to follow her example with anything like what we are used to think of as
good table manners. There were stewed quinces afterwards, and dates in
syrup, and thick yellowy cream. It was the kind of dinner you hardly ever
get in Fitzroy Street.</P>
<P>After dinner everybody went to sleep, even the children.</P>
<P>The Queen awoke with a start.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what a time we&rsquo;ve
slept! I must rush off and dress for the banquet. I shan&rsquo;t have much
more than time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Ritti&hyphen;Marduk got back with our sister and the
Psammead yet?&rdquo; Anthea asked.</P>
<PB ID="p156" N="156">
<P>&ldquo;I <EMPH>quite</EMPH> forgot to ask. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said
the Queen. &ldquo;And of course they wouldn&rsquo;t announce her unless I
told them to, except during justice hours. I expect she&rsquo;s waiting
outside. I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Ritti&hyphen;Marduk came in a moment later.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I regret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have been unable to find
your sister. The beast she bears with her in a basket has bitten the child
of the guard, and your sister and the beast set out to come to you. The
police say they have a clue. No doubt we shall have news of her in a few
weeks.&rdquo; He bowed and withdrew.</P>
<P>The horror of this threefold loss&mdash;Jane, the Psammead, and the
Amulet&mdash;gave the children something to talk about while the Queen was
dressing. I shall not report their conversation; it was very gloomy. Every
one repeated himself several times, and the discussion ended in each of
them blaming the other two for having let Jane go. You know the sort of
talk it was, don&rsquo;t you? At last Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;After all, she&rsquo;s with the Psammead, so
<EMPH>she&rsquo;s</EMPH> all right. The Psammead is jolly careful of itself
too. And it isn&rsquo;t as if we were in any danger. Let&rsquo;s try to
buck up and enjoy the banquet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They did enjoy the banquet. They had a beautiful bath, which was
delicious, were heavily oiled all over, including their hair, and that was
most unpleasant. Then they
<PB ID="p157" N="157">
dressed again and were presented to the King, who was most affable. The
banquet was long; there were all sorts of nice things to eat, and everybody
seemed to eat and drink a good deal. Every one lay on cushions and couches,
ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other; and after the eating was
done each lady went and sat by some gentleman, who seemed to be her
sweetheart or her husband, for they were very affectionate to each other.
The Court dresses had gold threads woven in them, very bright and
beautiful.</P>
<P>The middle of the room was left clear, and different people came and did
amusing things. There were conjurers and jugglers and
snake&hyphen;charmers, which last Anthea did not like at all.</P>
<P>When it got dark torches were lighted. Cedar splinters dipped in oil
blazed in copper dishes set high on poles.</P>
<P>Then there was a dancer, who hardly danced at all, only just struck
attitudes. She had hardly any clothes, and was not at all pretty. The
children were rather bored by her, but every one else was delighted,
including the King.</P>
<P>&ldquo;By the beard of Nimrod!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;ask what you like
girl, and you shall have it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I want nothing,&rdquo; said the dancer; &ldquo;the honour of
having pleased the King may&hyphen;he&hyphen;live&hyphen;for&hyphen;ever is
reward enough for me.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p158" N="158">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet158"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p159" N="159">
<P>And the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply that he
gave her the gold collar off his own neck.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said Cyril, awed by the magnificence of the
gift.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; whispered the Queen,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not his best collar by any means. We always keep a stock
of cheap jewellery for these occasions. And now&mdash;you promised to sing
us something. Would you like my minstrels to accompany you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Anthea quickly. The minstrels had been
playing off and on all the time, and their music reminded Anthea of the
band she and the others had once had on the fifth of November&mdash;with
penny horns, a tin whistle, a tea&hyphen;tray, the tongs, a
policeman&rsquo;s rattle, and a toy drum. They had enjoyed this band very
much at the time. But it was quite different when some one else was making
the same kind of music. Anthea understood now that Father had not been
really heartless and unreasonable when he had told them to stop that
infuriating din.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What shall we sing?&rdquo; Cyril was asking.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sweet and low?&rdquo; suggested Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Too soft&mdash;I vote for &lsquo;Who will o&rsquo;er the
downs.&rsquo; Now then&mdash;one, two, three.&rdquo;</P>
<Q><LG TYPE="stanza"><L>&ldquo;Oh, who will o&rsquo;er the downs so
free,</L><L REND="indent1">Oh, who will with me ride,</L><L>Oh, who will up

<P>Jane, the alto, was missing, and Robert, unlike the mother of the lady
in the song, never could &ldquo;keep the key,&rdquo; but the song, even so,
was sufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard to rouse the
Babylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;More, more,&rdquo; cried the King; &ldquo;by my beard, this
savage music is a new thing. Sing again!&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they sang&colon;</P>
<Q><LG TYPE="stanza"><L>&ldquo;I saw her bower at twilight

<P>Shouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse, and the King would
not be satisfied till they had sung all their part&hyphen;songs (they only
knew three) twice over, and ended up with &ldquo;Men of Harlech&rdquo; in
unison. Then the King stood up in his royal robes with his high, narrow
crown on his head and shouted&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;By the beak of Nisroch, ask what you
<PB ID="p161" N="161">
will, strangers from the land where the sun never sets!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We ought to say it&rsquo;s enough honour, like the dancer
did,&rdquo; whispered Anthea</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s ask for <EMPH>It</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m sure the other&rsquo;s manners,&rdquo; said
Anthea. But Robert, who was excited by the music, and the flaring torches,
and the applause and the opportunity, spoke up before the others could stop
him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Give us the half of the Amulet that has on it the
name <EMPH REND="smallcaps">UR&hyphen;HEKAU SETCHEH</EMPH>,&rdquo; he said,
adding as an afterthought, &ldquo;O King, live for ever.&rdquo;</P>
<P>As he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their
faces, and lay still. All but the Queen who crouched amid her cushions with
her head in her hands, and the King, who stood upright, perfectly still,
like the statue of a king in stone. It was only for a moment though. Then
his great voice thundered out&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Guard, seize them!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Instantly, from nowhere as it seemed, sprang eight soldiers in bright
armour inlaid with gold, and tunics of red and white. Very splendid they
were, and very alarming.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Impious and sacrilegious wretches!&rdquo; shouted the King.
&ldquo;to the dungeons with them! We will find a way, tomorrow, to make
them speak. For without doubt they can tell us where to find the lost half
of <EMPH>It</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>A wall of scarlet and white and steel and
<PB ID="p162" N="162">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet162"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p163" N="163">
gold closed up round the children and hurried them away among the many
pillars of the great hall. As they went they heard the voices of the
courtiers loud in horror.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it this time,&rdquo; said Cyril with extreme
bitterness.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, it will come right. It <EMPH>must</EMPH>. It always
does,&rdquo; said Anthea desperately.</P>
<P>They could not see where they were going, because the guard surrounded
them so closely, but the ground under their feet, smooth marble at first,
grew rougher like stone, then it was loose earth and sand, and they felt
the night air. Then there was more stone, and steps down.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief we really <EMPH>are</EMPH> going to the
deepest dungeon below the castle moat this time,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>And they were. At least it was not below a moat, but below the river
Euphrates, which was just as bad if not worse. In a most unpleasant place
it was. Dark, very, very damp, and with an odd, musty smell rather like the
shells of oysters. There was a torch&mdash;that is to say, a copper basket
on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it. By its light the children
saw that the walls were green, and that trickles of water ran down them and
dripped from the roof. There were things on the floor that looked like
newts, and in the dark corners creepy, shiny things moved sluggishly,
uneasily, horribly.</P>
<P>Robert&rsquo;s heart sank right into those really
<PB ID="p164" N="164">
reliable boots of his. Anthea and Cyril each had a private struggle with
that inside disagreeableness which is part of all of us, and which is
sometimes called the Old Adam&mdash;and both were victors. Neither of them
said to Robert (and both tried hard not even to think it), &ldquo;this is
<EMPH>your</EMPH> doing.&rdquo; Anthea had the additional temptation to
add, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; And she resisted it successfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sacrilege, and impious cheek,&rdquo; said the captain of the
guard to the gaoler. &ldquo;to be kept during the King&rsquo;s pleasure. I
expect he means to get some pleasure out of them tomorrow! He&rsquo;ll
tickle them up!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Poor little kids,&rdquo; said the gaoler.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got kids of
my own too. But it doesn&rsquo;t do to let domestic sentiment interfere
with one&rsquo;s public duties. Good night.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and
gold. The gaoler, with a bunch of big keys in his hand, stood looking
pityingly at the children. He shook his head twice and went out.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;I know it will be all right.
It&rsquo;s only a dream <EMPH>really</EMPH>, you know. It <EMPH>must</EMPH>
be! I don&rsquo;t believe about time being only a something or other of
thought. It <EMPH>is</EMPH> a dream, and we&rsquo;re bound to wake up all
right and safe.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said Cyril bitterly. And Robert suddenly
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my doing. If it really <EMPH>is</EMPH> all up do
<PB ID="p165" N="165">
please not keep a down on me about it, and tell Father&mdash; Oh, I
forgot.&rdquo;</P>
<P>What he had forgotten was that his father was three thousand miles and
five thousand or more years away from him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right, Bobs, old man,&rdquo; said Cyril; and Anthea got hold
of Robert&rsquo;s hand and squeezed it.</P>
<P>Then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard, flat cakes made of
coarse grain, very different from the
cream&hyphen;and&hyphen;juicy&hyphen;date feasts of the palace; also a
pitcher of water.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so very much. You <EMPH>are</EMPH> kind,&rdquo;
said Anthea feverishly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go to sleep,&rdquo; said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw
in a corner; &ldquo;tomorrow comes soon enough.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, dear Mr. Gaoler,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;whatever will
they do to us tomorrow?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll try to make you tell things,&rdquo; said the gaoler
grimly, &ldquo;and my advice is if you&rsquo;ve nothing to tell, make up
something. Then perhaps they&rsquo;ll sell you to the Northern nations.
Regular savages <EMPH>they</EMPH> are. Good night.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said three trembling voices, which their
owners strove in vain to render firm. Then he went out, and the three were
left alone in the damp, dim vault.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know the light won&rsquo;t last long,&rdquo; said Cyril,
looking at the flickering brazier.</P>
<PB ID="p166" N="166">
<P>&ldquo;Is it any good, do you think, calling on the name when we
haven&rsquo;t got the charm?&rdquo; suggested Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so. But we might try.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they tried. But the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained
unchanged.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What was the name the Queen said?&rdquo; asked Cyril suddenly.
&ldquo;Nisbeth&mdash;Nesbit&mdash;something? You know, the slave of the
great names?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wait a sec,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t know
why you want it. Nusroch&mdash;Nisrock&mdash;Nisroch&mdash;That&rsquo;s
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then Anthea pulled herself together. All her muscles tightened, and the
muscles of her mind and soul, if you can call them that, tightened too.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH REND="smallcaps">UR&hyphen;HEKAU SETCHEH</EMPH>,&rdquo; she
cried in a fervent voice. &ldquo;Oh, Nisroch, servant of the Great Ones,
come and help us!&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a waiting silence. Then a cold, blue light awoke in the corner
where the straw was&mdash;and in the light they saw coming towards them a
strange and terrible figure. I won&rsquo;t try to describe it, because Mr.
Millar will draw it for you, exactly as it was, and exactly as the old
Babylonians carved it on their stones, so that you can see it in our own
British Museum at this day. I will just say that it had eagle&rsquo;s wings
and an eagle&rsquo;s head and the body of a man.</P>
<P>It came towards them, strong and unspeakably horrible.</P>
<PB ID="p167" N="167">
<P>&ldquo;Oh, go away,&rdquo; cried Anthea; but Cyril cried, &ldquo;No;
stay!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The creature hesitated, then bowed low before them on the damp floor of
the dungeon.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; it said, in a harsh, grating voice like large rusty
keys being turned in locks. &ldquo;the servant of the Great Ones is
<EMPH>your</EMPH> servant. What is your need that you call on the name of
Nisroch?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We want to go home,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Anthea; &ldquo;we want to be where Jane
is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon.
And, as he pointed, the wall disappeared, and instead of the damp, green,
rocky surface, there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings of red silk
embroidered with golden water&hyphen;lilies, with cushioned couches and
great mirrors of polished steel; and in it was the Queen, and before her,
on a red pillow, sat the Psammead, its fur hunched up in an irritated,
discontented way. On a blue&hyphen;covered couch lay Jane fast asleep.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Walk forward without fear,&rdquo; said Nisroch. &ldquo;Is there
aught else that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak
that name?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, <EMPH>no</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now. Thanks ever so.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You are a dear,&rdquo; cried Anthea, not in the least knowing
what she was saying. &ldquo;Oh, thank you thank you. But <EMPH>do</EMPH> go
<EMPH>now</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p168" N="168">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet168"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p169" N="169">
<P>She caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in hers,
like a hand of stone.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go forward,&rdquo; said Nisroch. And they went.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, my good gracious,&rdquo; said the Queen as they stood before
her. &ldquo;How did you get here? I <EMPH>knew</EMPH> you were magic. I
meant to let you out the first thing in the morning, if I could slip
away&mdash;but thanks be to Dagon, you&rsquo;ve managed it for yourselves.
You must get away. I&rsquo;ll wake my chief lady and she shall call
Ritti&hyphen;Marduk, and he&rsquo;ll let you out the back way,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rouse anybody for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; said
Anthea, &ldquo;except Jane, and I&rsquo;ll rouse her.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She shook Jane with energy, and Jane slowly awoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ritti&hyphen;Marduk brought them in hours ago, really,&rdquo;
said the Queen, &ldquo;but I wanted to have the Psammead all to myself for
a bit. You&rsquo;ll excuse the little natural deception?&mdash;it&rsquo;s
part of the Babylonish character, don&rsquo;t you know? But I don&rsquo;t
want anything to happen to you. Do let me rouse some one.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; said Anthea with desperate earnestness. She
thought she knew enough of what the Babylonians were like when they were
roused. &ldquo;We can go by our own magic. And you will tell the King it
wasn&rsquo;t the gaoler&rsquo;s fault. It was Nisroch.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p170" N="170">
<P>&ldquo;Nisroch!&rdquo; echoed the Queen. &ldquo;You are indeed
magicians.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane sat up, blinking stupidly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hold It up, and say the word,&rdquo; cried Cyril, catching up the
Psammead, which mechanically bit him, but only very slightly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Which is the East?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Behind me,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ur&hyphen;Hekau Setcheh,&rdquo; said Jane sleepily, and held up
the charm.</P>
<P>And there they all were in the dining&hyphen;room at 300 Fitzroy
Street.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; cried Cyril with great presence of mind, &ldquo;go
and get the plate of sand down for the Psammead.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane went.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew
less loud on the stairs, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s tell her about the
dungeon and all that. It&rsquo;ll only frighten her so that she&rsquo;ll
never want to go anywhere else.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; said Cyril; but Anthea felt that she could not
have said a word to save her life.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why did you want to come back in such a hurry?&rdquo; asked Jane,
returning with the plate of sand. &ldquo;It was awfully jolly in Babylon, I
think! I liked it no end.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Cyril carelessly. &ldquo;It was jolly
enough, of course, but I thought we&rsquo;d been there long enough. Mother
always says you oughtn&rsquo;t to wear out your welcome!&rdquo;</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE QUEEN IN LONDON</HEAD>
<P>&ldquo;<HI>NOW</HI> tell us what happened to you,&rdquo; said Cyril to
Jane, when he and the others had told her all about the Queen&rsquo;s talk
and the banquet, and the variety entertainment, carefully stopping short
before the beginning of the dungeon part of the story.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t much good going,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;if you
didn&rsquo;t even try to get the Amulet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We found out it was no go,&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not to be got in Babylon. It was lost before that. We&rsquo;ll go to some
other jolly friendly place, where every one is kind and pleasant, and look
for it there. Now tell us about your part.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;the Queen&rsquo;s man with the
smooth face&mdash;what was his name?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ritti&hyphen;Marduk,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;Ritti&hyphen;Marduk, he came for me
just after the Psammead had bitten the
guard&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;gate&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s little boy, and
he took me to the Palace. And we had supper with the new little Queen from
Egypt. She
<PB ID="p173" N="173">
<EMPH>is</EMPH> a dear&mdash;not much older than you. She told me heaps
about Egypt. And we played ball after supper. And then the Babylon Queen
sent for me. I like her too. And she talked to the Psammead and I went to
sleep. And then you woke me up. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead, roused from its sound sleep, told the same story.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it added, &ldquo;what possessed you to tell that
Queen that I could give wishes? I sometimes think you were born without
even the most rudimentary imitation of brains.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children did not know the meaning of rudimentary, but it sounded a
rude, insulting word.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we did any harm,&rdquo; said Cyril
sulkily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the Psammead with withering irony, &ldquo;not
at all! Of course not! Quite the contrary! Exactly so! Only she happened to
wish that she might soon find herself in your country. And soon may mean
any moment.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s your fault,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;because
you might just as well have made &lsquo;soon&rsquo; mean some moment next
year or next century.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you, as so often happens, make the
mistake,&rdquo; rejoined the Sand&hyphen;fairy. &ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH>
couldn&rsquo;t mean anything but what <EMPH>she</EMPH> meant by
&lsquo;soon.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t my wish. And what <EMPH>she</EMPH>
meant was the next time the King happens to go out lion hunting. So
she&rsquo;ll
<PB ID="p174" N="174">
have a whole day, and perhaps two, to do as she wishes with.
<EMPH>She</EMPH> doesn&rsquo;t know about time only being a mode of
thought.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation, &ldquo;we
must do what we can to give her a good time. She was jolly decent to us. I
say, suppose we were to go to St James&rsquo;s Park after dinner and feed
those ducks that we never did feed. After all that Babylon and all those
years ago, I feel as if I should like to see something <EMPH>real</EMPH>,
and <EMPH>now</EMPH>. You&rsquo;ll come, Psammead?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes?&rdquo;
asked the Psammead morosely. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go out with nothing on.
And I won&rsquo;t, what&rsquo;s more.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had, in the
hurry of departure from Babylon, not been remembered.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not so extra precious,&rdquo; said Robert hastily.
&ldquo;You can get them given to you for nothing if you buy fish in
Farringdon Market.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Psammead very crossly indeed, &ldquo;so you
presume on my sublime indifference to the things of this disgusting modern
world, to fob me off with a travelling equipage that costs you nothing.
Very well, I shall go to sand. Please don&rsquo;t wake me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And it went then and there to sand, which, as you know, meant to bed.
The boys went
<PB ID="p175" N="175">
to St James&rsquo;s Park to feed the ducks, but they went alone.</P>
<P>Anthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon. They cut off half a yard
from each of their best green Liberty sashes. A towel cut in two formed a
lining; and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed. What they were making
was a bag for the Psammead. Each worked at a half of the bag. Jane&rsquo;s
half had four&hyphen;leaved shamrocks embroidered on it. They were the only
things she could do (because she had been taught how at school, and,
fortunately, some of the silk she had been taught with was left over). And
even so, Anthea had to draw the pattern for her. Anthea&rsquo;s side of the
bag had letters on it&mdash;worked hastily but affectionately in chain
stitch. They were something like
this&colon;<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet175"></FIGURE></P>
<P>She would have put &ldquo;travelling carriage,&rdquo; but she made the
letters too big, so there was no room. The bag was made <EMPH>into</EMPH> a
bag with old Nurse&rsquo;s sewing machine, and the strings
<PB ID="p176" N="176">
of it were Anthea&rsquo;s and Jane&rsquo;s best red hair ribbons. At
tea&hyphen;time, when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable
report of the St James&rsquo;s Park ducks, Anthea ventured to awaken the
Psammead, and to show it its new travelling bag.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at
the same time affectionately, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so dusty.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that
people said nowadays. For a creature that had in its time associated with
Megatheriums and Pterodactyls, its quickness was really wonderful.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more worthy of me,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;than the
kind of bag that&rsquo;s given away with a pound of plaice. When do you
propose to take me out in it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere,&rdquo; said
Cyril. But Jane said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I want to go to Egypt. I did like that Egyptian Princess that
came to marry the King in Babylon. She told me about the larks they have in
Egypt. And the cats. Do let&rsquo;s go there. And I told her what the bird
things on the Amulet were like. And she said it was Egyptian
writing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their
cleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors
<PB ID="p177" N="177">
they had suffered in the dungeon below the Euphrates.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Egypt&rsquo;s so nice too,&rdquo; Jane went on, &ldquo;because of
Doctor Brewer&rsquo;s Scripture History. I would like to go there when
Joseph was dreaming those curious dreams, or when Moses was doing wonderful
things with snakes and sticks.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about snakes,&rdquo; said Anthea
shuddering.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, we needn&rsquo;t be in at that part, but Babylon was
lovely! We had cream and sweet, sticky stuff. And I expect Egypt&rsquo;s
the same.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a good deal of discussion, but it all ended in
everybody&rsquo;s agreeing to Jane&rsquo;s idea. And next morning directly
after breakfast (which was kippers, and very nice) the Psammead was invited
to get into his travelling carriage.</P>
<P>The moment after it had done so, with stiff, furry reluctance, like that
of a cat when you want to nurse it, and its ideas are not the same as
yours, old Nurse came in.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, chickies,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you feeling very
dull?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no, Nurse dear,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re having
a lovely time. We&rsquo;re just going off to see some old, ancient
relics.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said old Nurse, &ldquo;the Royal Academy, I suppose?
Don&rsquo;t go wasting your money too reckless, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She cleared away the kipper bones and the
<PB ID="p178" N="178">
tea&hyphen;things, and when she had swept up the crumbs and removed the
cloth, the Amulet was held up and the order given&mdash;just as Duchesses
(and other people) give it to their coachmen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;To Egypt, please!&rdquo; said Anthea, when Cyril had uttered the
wonderful Name of Power.</P>
<P>&ldquo;When Moses was there,&rdquo; added Jane.</P>
<P>And there, in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining&hyphen;room, the Amulet
grew big, and it was an arch, and through it they saw a blue, blue sky and
a running river.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, stop!&rdquo; said Cyril, and pulled down Jane&rsquo;s hand
with the Amulet in it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What silly cuckoos we all are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course
we can&rsquo;t go. We daren&rsquo;t leave home for a single minute now, for
fear that minute should be <EMPH>the</EMPH> minute.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What minute be <EMPH>what</EMPH> minute?&rdquo; asked Jane
impatiently, trying to get her hand away from Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The minute when the Queen of Babylon comes,&rdquo; said Cyril.
And then every one saw it.</P>
<P>For some days life flowed in a very slow, dusty, uneventful stream. The
children could never go out all at once, because they never knew when the
King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his Queen free to pay
them that surprise visit to which she was, without doubt, eagerly looking
forward.</P>
<PB ID="p179" N="179">
<P>So they took it in turns, two and two, to go out and to stay in.</P>
<P>The stay&hyphen;at&hyphen;homes would have been much duller than they
were but for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>He called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple
and gold beads.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I saw one like that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the British Museum, perhaps?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I like to call the place where I saw it Babylon,&rdquo; said
Anthea cautiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A pretty fancy,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, &ldquo;and
quite correct too, because, as a matter of fact, these beads did come from
Babylon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The other three were all out that day. The boys had been going to the
Zoo, and Jane had said so plaintively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am fonder of
rhinoceroses than either of you are,&rdquo; that Anthea had told her to run
along then. And she had run, catching the boys before that part of the road
where Fitzroy Street suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I think Babylon is most frightfully interesting,&rdquo; said
Anthea. &ldquo;I do have such interesting dreams about it&mdash;at least,
not dreams exactly, but quite as wonderful.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do sit down and tell me,&rdquo; said he. So she sat down and
told. And he asked her a lot of questions, and she answered them as well as
she could.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wonderful&mdash;wonderful!&rdquo; he said at last.
<PB ID="p180" N="180">
&ldquo;One&rsquo;s heard of thought&hyphen;transference, but I never
thought <EMPH>I</EMPH> had any power of that sort. Yet it must be that, and
very bad for <EMPH>you</EMPH>, I should think. Doesn&rsquo;t your head ache
very much?&rdquo;</P>
<P>He suddenly put a cold, thin hand on her forehead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No thank you, not at all,&rdquo; said she.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I assure you it is not done intentionally,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Of course I know a good deal about Babylon, and I unconsciously
communicate it to you; you&rsquo;ve heard of thought&hyphen;reading, but
some of the things you say, I don&rsquo;t understand; they never enter my
head, and yet they&rsquo;re so astoundingly probable.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Anthea reassuringly.
&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> understand. And don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s all
quite simple really.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was not quite so simple when Anthea, having heard the others come in,
went down, and before she had had time to ask how they had liked the Zoo,
heard a noise outside, compared to which the wild beasts&rsquo; noises were
gentle as singing birds.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Anthea, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The loud hum of many voices came through the open window. Words could be
distinguished.</P>
<P>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a guy!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t November. That ain&rsquo;t no guy. It&rsquo;s a
ballet lady, that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not it&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo; looney, I tell
you.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p181" N="181">
<P>Then came a clear voice that they knew.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Retire, slaves!&rdquo; it said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she a saying of?&rdquo; cried a dozen voices.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Some blamed foreign lingo,&rdquo; one voice replied.</P>
<P>The children rushed to the door. A crowd was on the road and
pavement.</P>
<P>In the middle of the crowd, plainly to be seen from the top of the
steps, were the beautiful face and bright veil of the Babylonian Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jimminy!&rdquo; cried Robert, and ran down the steps, &ldquo;here
she is!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;look out&mdash;let the lady pass.
She&rsquo;s a friend of ours, coming to see us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nice friend for a respeckable house,&rdquo; snorted a fat woman
with marrows on a hand&hyphen;cart.</P>
<P>All the same the crowd made way a little. The Queen met Robert on the
pavement, and Cyril joined them, the Psammead bag still on his arm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the Psammead; you
can get wishes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> wish you&rsquo;d come in a different dress, if you
<EMPH>had</EMPH> to come,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no use
my wishing anything.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;I wish I was dressed&mdash;no,
I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I wish <EMPH>they</EMPH> were dressed properly, then
they wouldn&rsquo;t be so silly.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p182" N="182">
<P>The Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it;
and suddenly every man, woman, and child in that crowd felt that it had not
enough clothes on. For, of course, the Queen&rsquo;s idea of proper dress
was the dress that had been proper for the working&hyphen;classes three
thousand years ago in Babylon&mdash;and there was not much of it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Lawky me!&rdquo; said the marrow&hyphen;selling woman,
&ldquo;whatever could a&hyphen;took me to come out this figure?&rdquo; and
she wheeled her cart away very quickly indeed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s made a pretty guy of you&mdash;talk of
guys,&rdquo; said a man who sold bootlaces.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you talk,&rdquo; said the man next to him.
&ldquo;Look at your own silly legs; and where&rsquo;s your
boots?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I never come out like this, I&rsquo;ll take my sacred,&rdquo;
said the bootlace&hyphen;seller. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t quite myself last
night, I&rsquo;ll own, but not to dress up like a circus.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The crowd was all talking at once, and getting rather angry. But no one
seemed to think of blaming the Queen.</P>
<P>Anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up; the others followed,
and the door was shut.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Blowed if I can make it out!&rdquo; they heard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
off home, I am.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And the crowd, coming slowly to the same mind, dispersed, followed by
another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the Queen thought was
the proper way.</P>
<PB ID="p183" N="183">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet183"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p184" N="184">
<P>&ldquo;We shall have the police here directly,&rdquo; said Anthea in the
tones of despair. &ldquo;Oh, why did you come dressed like that?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Queen leaned against the arm of the horse&hyphen;hair sofa.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How else can a queen dress I should like to know?&rdquo; she
questioned.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Our Queen wears things like other people,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t. And I must say,&rdquo; she remarked in an
injured tone, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t seem very glad to see me now I
<EMPH>have</EMPH> come. But perhaps it&rsquo;s the surprise that makes you
behave like this. Yet you ought to be used to surprises. The way you
vanished! I shall never forget it. The best magic I&rsquo;ve ever seen. How
did you do it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, never mind about that now,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;You see
you&rsquo;ve gone and upset all those people, and I expect they&rsquo;ll
fetch the police. And we don&rsquo;t want to see you collared and put in
prison.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put queens in prison,&rdquo; she said
loftily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;We cut off a
king&rsquo;s head here once.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In this miserable room? How frightfully interesting.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no, not in this room; in history.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, in <EMPH>that</EMPH>,&rdquo; said the Queen disparagingly.
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d done it with your own hands.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The girls shuddered.</P>
<PB ID="p185" N="185">
<P>&ldquo;What a hideous city yours is,&rdquo; the Queen went on
pleasantly, &ldquo;and what horrid, ignorant people. Do you know they
actually can&rsquo;t understand a single word I say.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Can you understand them?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course not; they speak some vulgar, Northern dialect. I can
understand <EMPH>you</EMPH> quite well.&rdquo;</P>
<P>I really am not going to explain <EMPH>again</EMPH> how it was that the
children could understand other languages than their own so thoroughly, and
talk them, too, so that it felt and sounded (to them) just as though they
were talking English.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyril bluntly, &ldquo;now you&rsquo;ve seen
just how horrid it is, don&rsquo;t you think you might as well go home
again?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve seen simply nothing yet,&rdquo; said the Queen,
arranging her starry veil. &ldquo;I wished to be at your door, and I was.
Now I must go and see your King and Queen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s allowed to,&rdquo; said Anthea in haste;
&ldquo;but look here, we&rsquo;ll take you and show you anything
you&rsquo;d like to see&mdash;anything you <EMPH>can</EMPH> see,&rdquo; she
added kindly, because she remembered how nice the Queen had been to them in
Babylon, even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter of Jane and
Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Museum,&rdquo; said Cyril hopefully;
&ldquo;there are lots of things from your country there. If only we could
disguise you a little.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p186" N="186">
<P>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Anthea suddenly. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s old
theatre cloak, and there are a lot of her old hats in the big
box.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The blue silk, lace&hyphen;trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the
Queen&rsquo;s startling splendours, but the hat fitted very badly. It had
pink roses in it; and there was something about the coat or the hat or the
Queen, that made her look somehow not very respectable.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, never mind,&rdquo; said Anthea, when Cyril whispered this.
&ldquo;the thing is to get her out before Nurse has finished her forty
winks. I should think she&rsquo;s about got to the thirty&hyphen;ninth wink
by now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;You know how dangerous
it is. Let&rsquo;s make haste into the Museum. If any of those people you
made guys of do fetch the police, they won&rsquo;t think of looking for you
there.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The blue silk coat and the pink&hyphen;rosed hat attracted almost as
much attention as the royal costume had done; and the children were
uncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of the
Museum.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Parcels and umbrellas to be left here,&rdquo; said a man at the
counter.</P>
<P>The party had no umbrellas, and the only parcel was the bag containing
the Psammead, which the Queen had insisted should be brought.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I&rsquo;m</EMPH> not going to be left,&rdquo; said the
Psammead softly, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t you think it.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p187" N="187">
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait outside with you,&rdquo; said Anthea hastily, and
went to sit on the seat near the drinking fountain.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit so near that nasty fountain,&rdquo; said the
creature crossly; &ldquo;I might get splashed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited. Indeed she waited,
and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The Psammead dropped into
an uneasy slumber. Anthea had long ceased to watch the swing&hyphen;door
that always let out the wrong person, and she was herself almost asleep,
and still the others did not come back.</P>
<P>It was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they
<EMPH>had</EMPH> come back, and that they were not alone. Behind them was
quite a crowd of men in uniform, and several gentlemen were there. Every
one seemed very angry.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; said the nicest of the angry gentlemen.
&ldquo;Take the poor, demented thing home and tell your parents she ought
to be properly looked after.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get her to go we must send for the
police,&rdquo; said the nastiest gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t wish to use harsh measures,&rdquo; added the
nice one, who was really very nice indeed, and seemed to be over all the
others.</P>
<P>&ldquo;May I speak to my sister a moment first?&rdquo; asked Robert.</P>
<P>The nicest gentleman nodded, and the
<PB ID="p188" N="188">
officials stood round the Queen, the others forming a sort of guard while
Robert crossed over to Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Everything you can think of,&rdquo; he replied to Anthea&rsquo;s
glance of inquiry. &ldquo;Kicked up the most frightful shine in there. Said
those necklaces and earrings and things in the glass cases were all
hers&mdash;would have them out of the cases. Tried to break the
glass&mdash;she did break one bit! Everybody in the place has been at her.
No good. I only got her out by telling her that was the place where they
cut queens&rsquo; heads off.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, Bobs, what a whacker!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have told a whackinger one to get her out. Besides,
it wasn&rsquo;t. I meant <EMPH>mummy</EMPH> queens. How do you know they
don&rsquo;t cut off mummies&rsquo; heads to see how the embalming is done?
What I want to say is, can&rsquo;t you get her to go with you
quietly?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Anthea, and went up to the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do come home,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the learned gentleman in
our house has a much nicer necklace than anything they&rsquo;ve got here.
Come and see it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Queen nodded.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the nastiest gentleman, &ldquo;she does
understand English.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I was talking Babylonian, I think,&rdquo; said Anthea
bashfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;My good child,&rdquo; said the nice gentleman, &ldquo;what
you&rsquo;re talking is not Babylonian, but
<PB ID="p189" N="189">
nonsense. You just go home <EMPH>at once</EMPH>, and tell your parents
exactly what has happened.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea took the Queen&rsquo;s hand and gently pulled her away. The other
children followed, and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the
steps watching them. It was when the little party of disgraced children,
with the Queen who had disgraced them, had reached the middle of the
courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the Psammead was. She stopped
short.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she said, very loud and clear, &ldquo;that all
those Babylonian things would come out to me here&mdash;slowly, so that
those dogs and slaves can see the working of the great Queen&rsquo;s
magic.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, you <EMPH>are</EMPH> a tiresome woman,&rdquo; said the
Psammead in its bag, but it puffed itself out.</P>
<P>Next moment there was a crash. The glass swing doors and all their
framework were smashed suddenly and completely. The crowd of angry
gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this. But the nastiest
of them was not quick enough, and he was roughly pushed out of the way by
an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily through the door. It came
and stood beside the Queen in the middle of the courtyard.</P>
<P>It was followed by more stone images, by great slabs of carved stone,
bricks, helmets, tools, weapons, fetters, wine&hyphen;jars, bowls, bottles,
vases, jugs, saucers, seals, and the round long things, something like
rolling pins
<PB ID="p190" N="190">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet190"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p191" N="191">
with marks on them like the print of little bird&hyphen;feet, necklaces,
collars, rings, armlets, earrings&mdash;heaps and heaps and heaps of
things, far more than anyone had time to count, or even to see
distinctly.</P>
<P>All the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps except
the nice one. He stood with his hands in his pockets just as though he was
quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of small Babylonish
objects float out into the Museum yard. But he sent a man to close the big
iron gates.</P>
<P>A journalist, who was just leaving the museum, spoke to Robert as he
passed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Theosophy, I suppose?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is she Mrs.
Besant?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Yes</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Robert recklessly.</P>
<P>The journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut. He
rushed off to Fleet Street, and his paper got out a new edition within half
an hour.</P>
<P>&ldquo;MRS BESANT AND THEOSOPHY.</P>
<P>&ldquo;IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.&rdquo;</P>
<P>People saw it in fat, black letters on the boards carried by the sellers
of newspapers. Some few people who had nothing better to do went down to
the Museum on the tops of omnibuses. But by the time they got there there
was nothing to be seen. For the Baby&hyphen;
<PB ID="p192" N="192">
lonian Queen had suddenly seen the closed gates, had felt the threat of
them, and had said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we were in your house.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And, of course, instantly they were.</P>
<P>The Psammead was furious.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll come after you,
and they&rsquo;ll find <EMPH>me</EMPH>. There&rsquo;ll be a National Cage
built for me at Westminster, and I shall have to work at politics. Why
wouldn&rsquo;t you leave the things in their places?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a temper you have, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the Queen
serenely. &ldquo;I wish all the things were back in their places. Will
<EMPH>that</EMPH> do for you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t refuse to give your wishes,&rdquo; it said,
&ldquo;but I can Bite. And I will if this goes on. Now then.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; whispered Anthea close to its bristling
ear; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadful for us too. Don&rsquo;t <EMPH>you</EMPH>
desert us. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll wish herself at home again soon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not she,&rdquo; said the Psammead a little less crossly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take me to see your City,&rdquo; said the Queen.</P>
<P>The children looked at each other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If we had some money we could take her about in a cab. People
wouldn&rsquo;t notice her so much then. But we haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sell this,&rdquo; said the Queen, taking a ring from her
finger.</P>
<PB ID="p193" N="193">
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d only think we&rsquo;d stolen it,&rdquo; said Cyril
bitterly, &ldquo;and put us in prison.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All roads lead to prison with you, it seems,&rdquo; said the
Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The learned gentleman!&rdquo; said Anthea, and ran up to him with
the ring in her hand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you buy this for a
pound?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said in tones of joy and amazement, and took the
ring into his hand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my very own,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;it was given
to me to sell.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you a pound,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman,
&ldquo;with pleasure; and I&rsquo;ll take care of the ring for you. Who did
you say gave it to you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We call her,&rdquo; said Anthea carefully, &ldquo;the Queen of
Babylon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is it a game?&rdquo; he asked hopefully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a pretty game if I don&rsquo;t get the money to
pay for cabs for her,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I sometimes think,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that I am
becoming insane, or that&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or that I am; but I&rsquo;m not, and you&rsquo;re not, and
she&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Does she <EMPH>say</EMPH> that she&rsquo;s the Queen of
Babylon?&rdquo; he uneasily asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea recklessly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This thought&hyphen;transference is more far&hyphen;reaching than
I imagined,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose I have unconsciously
influenced <EMPH>her</EMPH>, too. I never thought my Babylonish studies
<PB ID="p194" N="194">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet194"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p195" N="195">
would bear fruit like this. Horrible! There are more things in heaven and
earth&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;heaps more. And the pound is the
thing <EMPH>I</EMPH> want more than anything on earth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He ran his fingers through his thin hair.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This thought&hyphen;transference!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s undoubtedly a Babylonian ring&mdash;or it seems so to me.
But perhaps I have hypnotised myself. I will see a doctor the moment I have
corrected the last proofs of my book.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, do!&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and thank you so very
much.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She took the sovereign and ran down to the others.</P>
<P>And now from the window of a four&hyphen;wheeled cab the Queen of
Babylon beheld the wonders of London. Buckingham Palace she thought
uninteresting; Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament were little
better. But she liked the Tower, and the River, and the ships filled her
with wonder and delight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But how badly you keep your slaves. How wretched and poor and
neglected they seem,&rdquo; she said, as the cab rattled along the Mile End
Road.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t slaves; they&rsquo;re
working&hyphen;people,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re working&hyphen;people. That&rsquo;s what
slaves are. Don&rsquo;t you tell me. Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t know a
slave&rsquo;s face when I see it? Why don&rsquo;t their masters see that
<PB ID="p196" N="196">
they&rsquo;re better fed and better clothed? Tell me in three
words.&rdquo;</P>
<P>No one answered. The wage&hyphen;system of modern England is a little
difficult to explain in three words even if you understand it&mdash;which
the children didn&rsquo;t.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a revolt of your slaves if you&rsquo;re not
careful,&rdquo; said the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;you see they have
votes&mdash;that makes them safe not to revolt. It makes all the
difference. Father told me so.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is this vote?&rdquo; asked the Queen. &ldquo;Is it a charm?
What do they do with it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the harassed Cyril;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a vote, that&rsquo;s all! They don&rsquo;t do
anything particular with it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;a sort of plaything. Well, I
wish that all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their full
of their favourite meat and drink.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Instantly all the people in the Mile End Road, and in all the other
streets where poor people live, found their hands full of things to eat and
drink. From the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind of
food, and bottles and cans as well. Roast meat, fowls, red lobsters, great
yellowy crabs, fried fish, boiled pork, beef&hyphen;steak puddings, baked
onions, mutton pies; most of the young people had oranges and sweets and
cake. It made an enormous change in the look of the Mile End
Road&mdash;brightened it up, so to speak,
<PB ID="p197" N="197">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet197"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p198" N="198">
and brightened up, more than you can possibly imagine, the faces of the
people.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Makes a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best wish you&rsquo;ve had yet,&rdquo; said Jane
with cordial approval.</P>
<P>Just by the Bank the cabman stopped.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to drive you no further,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Out you gets.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They got out rather unwillingly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wants my tea,&rdquo; he said; and they saw that on the box of
the cab was a mound of cabbage, with pork chops and apple sauce, a duck,
and a spotted currant pudding. Also a large can.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You pay me my fare,&rdquo; he said threateningly, and looked down
at the mound, muttering again about his tea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take another cab,&rdquo; said Cyril with dignity.
&ldquo;Give me change for a sovereign, if you please.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But the cabman, as it turned out, was not at all a nice character. He
took the sovereign, whipped up his horse, and disappeared in the stream of
cabs and omnibuses and wagons, without giving them any change at all.</P>
<P>Already a little crowd was collecting round the party.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Robert, leading the wrong way.</P>
<P>The crowd round them thickened. They were in a narrow street where many
gentlemen in black coats and without hats were
<PB ID="p199" N="199">
standing about on the pavement talking very loudly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How ugly their clothes are,&rdquo; said the Queen of Babylon.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be rather fine men, some of them, if they were dressed
decently, especially the ones with the beautiful long, curved noses. I wish
they were dressed like the Babylonians of my court.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And of course, it was so.</P>
<P>The moment the almost fainting Psammead had blown itself out every man
in Throgmorton Street appeared abruptly in Babylonian full dress.</P>
<P>All were carefully powdered, their hair and beards were scented and
curled, their garments richly embroidered. They wore rings and armlets,
flat gold collars and swords, and impossible&hyphen;looking
head&hyphen;dresses.</P>
<P>A stupefied silence fell on them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; a youth who had always been fair&hyphen;haired
broke that silence, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only fancy of course&mdash;something
wrong with my eyes&mdash;but you chaps do look so rum.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Rum,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;Look at <EMPH>you</EMPH>. You
in a sash! My hat! And your hair&rsquo;s gone black and you&rsquo;ve got a
beard. It&rsquo;s my belief we&rsquo;ve been poisoned. You do look a
jackape.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Old Levinstein don&rsquo;t look so bad. But how was it
<EMPH>done</EMPH>&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I want to know. How
<EMPH>was</EMPH> it done? Is it conjuring, or what?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I think it is chust a ver&rsquo; bad tream,&rdquo; said old
Levinstein to his clerk; &ldquo;all along
<PB ID="p200" N="200">
Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people have their hants full of
food&mdash;<EMPH>goot</EMPH> food. Oh yes, without doubt a very bad
tream!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m dreaming too, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk, looking
down at his legs with an expression of loathing. &ldquo;I see my feet in
beastly sandals as plain as plain.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All that goot food wasted,&rdquo; said old Mr Levinstein. A bad
tream&mdash;a bad tream.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a noisy
lot. But the noise they made now to express their disgust at the costumes
of ancient Babylon, was far louder than their ordinary row. One had to
shout before one could hear oneself speak.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; said the clerk who thought it was
conjuring&mdash;he was quite close to the children and they trembled,
because they knew that whatever he wished would come true. &ldquo;I only
wish we knew who&rsquo;d done it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And, of course, instantly they did know, and they pressed round the
Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Scandalous! Shameful! Ought to be put down by law. Give her in
charge. Fetch the police,&rdquo; two or three voices shouted at once.</P>
<P>The Queen recoiled.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;they sound like caged
lions&mdash;lions by the thousand. What is it that they say?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They say &lsquo;Police!,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Cyril briefly.
&ldquo;I knew they would sooner or later. And I don&rsquo;t blame them,
mind you.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p201" N="201">
<P>&ldquo;I wish my guards were here!&rdquo; cried the Queen. The exhausted
Psammead was panting and trembling, but the Queen&rsquo;s guards in red and
green garments, and brass and iron gear, choked Throgmorton Street, and
bared weapons flashed round the Queen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mad,&rdquo; said a Mr Rosenbaum; &ldquo;dat&rsquo;s
what it is&mdash;mad!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a judgement on you, Rosy,&rdquo; said his partner.
&ldquo;I always said you were too hard in that matter of Flowerdew.
It&rsquo;s a judgement, and I&rsquo;m in it too.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from the
gleaming blades, the mailed figures, the hard, cruel Eastern faces. But
Throgmorton Street is narrow, and the crowd was too thick for them to get
away as quickly as they wished.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Kill them,&rdquo; cried the Queen. &ldquo;Kill the
dogs!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The guards obeyed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>is</EMPH> all a dream,&rdquo; cried Mr Levinstein,
cowering in a doorway behind his clerk.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. Oh,
my good gracious! those foreign brutes are killing everybody. Henry Hirsh
is down now, and Prentice is cut in two&mdash;oh, Lord! and Huth, and there
goes Lionel Cohen with his head off, and Guy Nickalls has lost his head
now. A dream? I wish to goodness it was all a dream.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And, of course, instantly it was! The entire Stock Exchange rubbed its
eyes and went
<PB ID="p202" N="202">
back to close, to over, and either side of seven&hyphen;eights, and Trunks,
and Kaffirs, and Steel Common, and Contangoes, and Backwardations, Double
Options, and all the interesting subjects concerning which they talk in the
Street without ceasing.</P>
<P>No one said a word about it to anyone else. I think I have explained
before that business men do not like it to be known that they have been
dreaming in business hours. Especially mad dreams including such dreadful
things as hungry people getting dinners, and the destruction of the Stock
Exchange.</P>
<P>The children were in the dining&hyphen;room at 300, Fitzroy Street, pale
and trembling. The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag, and lay
flat on the table, its leg stretched out, looking more like a dead hare
than anything else.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank Goodness that&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said Anthea, drawing a
deep breath.</P>
<P>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t come back, will she?&rdquo; asked Jane
tremulously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;she&rsquo;s thousands of years ago.
But we spent a whole precious pound on her. It&rsquo;ll take all our
pocket&hyphen;money for ages to pay that back.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not if it was <EMPH>all</EMPH> a dream,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;The wish said <EMPH>all</EMPH> a dream, you know, Panther; you cut
up and ask if he lent you anything.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p203" N="203">
<P>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Anthea politely, following the
sound of her knock into the presence of the learned gentleman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry to trouble you, but <EMPH>did</EMPH> you lend me
a pound today?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, looking kindly at her through his spectacles.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s extraordinary that you should ask me, for I dozed for
a few moments this afternoon, a thing I very rarely do, and I dreamed quite
distinctly that you brought me a ring that you said belonged to the Queen
of Babylon, and that I lent you a sovereign, and that you left one of the
Queen&rsquo;s rings here. The ring was a magnificent specimen.&rdquo; He
sighed. &ldquo;I wish it hadn&rsquo;t been a dream,&rdquo; he said smiling.
He was really learning to smile quite nicely.</P>
<P>Anthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there to
grant his wish.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ATLANTIS</HEAD>
<P><HI>YOU</HI> will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen
in London was the only one that had occupied any time at all. But the
children&rsquo;s time was very fully taken up by talking over all the
wonderful things seen and done in the Past, where, by the power of the
Amulet, they seemed to spend hours and hours, only to find when they got
back to London that the whole thing had been briefer than a lightning
flash.</P>
<P>They talked of the Past at their meals, in their walks, in the
dining&hyphen;room, in the first&hyphen;floor drawing&hyphen;room, but most
of all on the stairs. It was an old house; it had once been a fashionable
one, and was a fine one still. The banister rails of the stairs were
excellent for sliding down, and in the corners of the landings were big
alcoves that had once held graceful statues, and now quite often held the
graceful forms of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.</P>
<P>One day Cyril and Robert in tight white
<PB ID="p205" N="205">
underclothing had spent a pleasant hour in reproducing the attitudes of
statues seen either in the British Museum, or in Father&rsquo;s big
photograph book. But the show ended abruptly because Robert wanted to be
the Venus of Milo, and for this purpose pulled at the sheet which served
for drapery at the very moment when Cyril, looking really quite like the
Discobolos&mdash;with a gold and white saucer for the disc&mdash;was
standing on one foot, and under that one foot was the sheet.</P>
<P>Of course the Discobolos and his disc and the would&hyphen;be Venus came
down together, and every one was a good deal hurt, especially the saucer,
which would never be the same again, however neatly one might join its
uneven bits with seccotine or the white of an egg.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied,&rdquo; said Cyril, holding his
head where a large lump was rising.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Quite, thanks,&rdquo; said Robert bitterly. His thumb had caught
in the banisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I <EMPH>am</EMPH> so sorry, poor, dear Squirrel,&rdquo; said
Anthea; &ldquo;and you were looking so lovely. I&rsquo;ll get a wet rag.
Bobs, go and hold your hand under the hot&hyphen;water tap. It&rsquo;s what
ballet girls do with their legs when they hurt them. I saw it in a
book.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo; said Robert disagreeably. But he went.</P>
<P>When he came back Cyril&rsquo;s head had been bandaged by his sisters,
and he had been
<PB ID="p206" N="206">
brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to admit that he
supposed Robert hadn&rsquo;t done it on purpose.</P>
<P>Robert replying with equal suavity, Anthea hastened to lead the talk
away from the accident.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t feel like going anywhere through the
Amulet,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Egypt!&rdquo; said Jane promptly. &ldquo;I want to see the pussy
cats.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not me&mdash;too hot,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about
as much as I can stand here&mdash;let alone Egypt.&rdquo; It was indeed,
hot, even on the second landing, which was the coolest place in the house.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the North Pole.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose the Amulet was ever there&mdash;and we
might get our fingers frost&hyphen;bitten so that we could never hold it up
to get home again. No thanks,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get the Psammead and
ask its advice. It will like us asking, even if we don&rsquo;t take
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag, but
before it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s
room opened and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him was
heard on the stairs. He seemed to be speaking with the door handle in his
hand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see a doctor, old boy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;all that about
thought&hyphen;transference is just simply twaddle. You&rsquo;ve been
over&hyphen;working. Take a holiday. Go to Dieppe.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p207" N="207">
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to Babylon,&rdquo; said the learned
gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go to Atlantis some time, while we&rsquo;re
about it, so as to give me some tips for my <BIBL>Nineteenth Century</BIBL>
article when you come home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; said the voice of the learned
gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Goodbye. Take care of yourself.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The door was banged, and the visitor came smiling down the
stairs&mdash;a stout, prosperous, big man. The children had to get up to
let him pass.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo, Kiddies,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the bandages on the
head of Cyril and the hand of Robert, &ldquo;been in the wars?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I say, what was
that Atlantic place you wanted him to go to? We couldn&rsquo;t help hearing
you talk.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You talk so <EMPH>very</EMPH> loud, you see,&rdquo; said Jane
soothingly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Atlantis,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;the lost Atlantis,
garden of the Hesperides. Great continent&mdash;disappeared in the sea. You
can read about it in Plato.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Cyril doubtfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Were there any Amulets there?&rdquo; asked Anthea, made anxious
by a sudden thought.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hundreds, I should think. So <EMPH>he&rsquo;s</EMPH> been talking
to you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, often. He&rsquo;s very kind to us. We like him
awfully.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, what he wants is a holiday; you
<PB ID="p208" N="208">
persuade him to take one. What he wants is a change of scene. You see, his
head is crusted so thickly inside with knowledge about Egypt and Assyria
and things that you can&rsquo;t hammer anything into it unless you keep
hard at it all day long for days and days. And I haven&rsquo;t time. But
you live in the house. You can hammer almost incessantly. Just try your
hands, will you? Right. So long!&rdquo;</P>
<P>He went down the stairs three at a time, and Jane remarked that he was a
nice man, and she thought he had little girls of his own.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should like to have them to play with,&rdquo; she added
pensively.</P>
<P>The three elder ones exchanged glances. Cyril nodded.</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right. <EMPH>let&rsquo;s</EMPH> go to Atlantis,&rdquo; he
said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Atlantis and take the learned gentleman with
us,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s a dream,
afterwards, but it&rsquo;ll certainly be a change of scene.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why not take him to nice Egypt?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Too hot,&rdquo; said Cyril shortly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or Babylon, where he wants to go?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of Babylon,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;at
least for the present. And so have the others. I don&rsquo;t know
why,&rdquo; he added, forestalling the question on Jane&rsquo;s lips,
&ldquo;but somehow we have. Squirrel, let&rsquo;s take off these beastly
bandages and get into flannels. We can&rsquo;t go in our unders.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p209" N="209">
<P>&ldquo;He <EMPH>wished</EMPH> to go to Atlantis, so he&rsquo;s got to go
some time; and he might as well go with us,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>This was how it was that the learned gentleman, permitting himself a few
moments of relaxation in his chair, after the fatigue of listening to
opinions (about Atlantis and many other things) with which he did not at
all agree, opened his eyes to find his four young friends standing in front
of him in a row.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Will you come,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;to Atlantis with
us?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;To know that you are dreaming shows that the dream is nearly at
an end,&rdquo; he told himself; &ldquo;or perhaps it&rsquo;s only a game,
like &lsquo;How many miles to Babylon?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P>So he said aloud&colon; &ldquo;Thank you very much, but I have only a
quarter of an hour to spare.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take any time,&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;time is
only a mode of thought, you know, and you&rsquo;ve got to go some time, so
why not with us?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, now quite certain
that he was dreaming.</P>
<P>Anthea held out her soft, pink hand. He took it. She pulled him gently
to his feet. Jane held up the Amulet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;To just outside Atlantis,&rdquo; said Cyril, and Jane said the
Name of Power.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You owl!&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an island. Outside
an island&rsquo;s all water.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p210" N="210">
<P>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go. I <EMPH>won&rsquo;t</EMPH>,&rdquo; said the
Psammead, kicking and struggling in its bag.</P>
<P>But already the Amulet had grown to a great arch. Cyril pushed the
learned gentleman, as undoubtedly the first&hyphen;born, through the
arch&mdash;not into water, but on to a wooden floor, out of doors. The
others followed. The Amulet grew smaller again, and there they all were,
standing on the deck of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast with
chains to rings on a white quay&hyphen;side. The rings and the chains were
of a metal that shone red&hyphen;yellow like gold.</P>
<P>Every one on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of
newcomers from Fitzroy Street. Those who seemed to be officers were
shouting orders to the men.</P>
<P>They stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond
it. What they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever
seen&mdash;or ever dreamed of.</P>
<P>The blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight; little white&hyphen;capped waves
broke softly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a
great city from the wildness of winter winds and seas. The quay was of
marble, white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold. The city was of
marble, red and white. The greater buildings that seemed to be temples and
palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver, but most of the
roofs were of copper that glowed golden&hyphen;red
<PB ID="p211" N="211">
on the houses on the hills among which the city stood, and shaded into
marvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been touched
by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting works of the
lower town.</P>
<P>Broad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to a
sort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles, and beyond rose the
town built on a hill.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman drew a long breath. &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;wonderful!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say, Mr.&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He means,&rdquo; said Anthea, with gentle politeness, &ldquo;that
we never can remember your name. I know it&rsquo;s Mr De
Something.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;When I was your age I was called Jimmy,&rdquo; he said timidly.
&ldquo;Would you mind? I should feel more at home in a dream like this if
I&mdash; Anything that made me seem more like one of you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Anthea with an effort. It
seemed such a cheek to be saying Jimmy to a grown&hyphen;up man.
&ldquo;Jimmy, <EMPH>dear</EMPH>,&rdquo; she added, with no effort at all.
Jimmy smiled and looked pleased.</P>
<P>But now the ship was made fast, and the Captain had time to notice other
things. He came towards them, and he was dressed in the best of all
possible dresses for the seafaring life.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked
<PB ID="p212" N="212">
rather fiercely. &ldquo;Do you come to bless or to curse?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;To bless, of course,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if
it annoys you, but we&rsquo;re here by magic. We come from the land of the
sun&hyphen;rising,&rdquo; he went on explanatorily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Captain; no one had expected that he
would. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice at first, but of course I hope
you&rsquo;re a good omen. It&rsquo;s needed. And this,&rdquo; he pointed to
the learned gentleman, &ldquo;your slave, I presume?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a very great
man. A sage, don&rsquo;t they call it? And we want to see all your
beautiful city, and your temples and things, and then we shall go back, and
he will tell his friend, and his friend will write a book about
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; asked the Captain, fingering a rope, &ldquo;is a
book?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A record&mdash;something written, or,&rdquo; she added hastily,
remembering the Babylonian writing, &ldquo;or engraved.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Some sudden impulse of confidence made Jane pluck the Amulet from the
neck of her frock.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Like this,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>The Captain looked at it curiously, but, the other three were relieved
to notice, without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere name of
it had roused in Egypt and Babylon.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The stone is of our country,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and
<PB ID="p213" N="213">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet213"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p214" N="214">
that which is engraved on it, it is like our writing, but I cannot read it.
What is the name of your sage?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ji&mdash;jimmy,&rdquo; said Anthea hesitatingly.</P>
<P>The Captain repeated, &ldquo;Ji&mdash;jimmy. Will you land?&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;And shall I lead you to the Kings?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;does your King hate
strangers?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Our Kings are ten,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;and the Royal
line, unbroken from Poseidon, the father of us all, has the noble tradition
to do honour to strangers if they come in peace.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then lead on, please,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;though I
<EMPH>should</EMPH> like to see all over your beautiful ship, and sail
about in her.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That shall be later,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;just now
we&rsquo;re afraid of a storm&mdash;do you notice that odd
rumbling?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing, master,&rdquo; said an old sailor who stood
near; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the pilchards coming in, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Too loud,&rdquo; said the Captain.</P>
<P>There was a rather anxious pause; then the Captain stepped on to the
quay, and the others followed him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do talk to him&mdash;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Anthea as they went;
&ldquo;you can find out all sorts of things for your friend&rsquo;s
book.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Please excuse me,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;If I talk I
shall wake up; and besides, I can&rsquo;t understand what he
says.&rdquo;</P>
<P>No one else could think of anything to say,
<PB ID="p215" N="215">
so that it was in complete silence that they followed the Captain up the
marble steps and through the streets of the town. There were streets and
shops and houses and markets.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like Babylon,&rdquo; whispered Jane, &ldquo;only
everything&rsquo;s perfectly different.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great comfort the ten Kings have been properly
brought up&mdash;to be kind to strangers,&rdquo; Anthea whispered to
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no deepest dungeons here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There were no horses or chariots in the street, but there were handcarts
and low trolleys running on thick log&hyphen;wheels, and porters carrying
packets on their heads, and a good many of the people were riding on what
looked like elephants, only the great beasts were hairy, and they had not
that mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the faces of the
elephants at the Zoo.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Mammoths!&rdquo; murmured the learned gentleman, and stumbled
over a loose stone.</P>
<P>The people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along,
but the Captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew uncomfortably
thick by saying&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Children of the Sun God and their High Priest&mdash;come to bless
the City.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like
a suppressed cheer.</P>
<P>Many of the buildings were covered with gold, but the gold on the bigger
buildings was of a different colour, and they had sorts of
<PB ID="p216" N="216">
steeples of burnished silver rising above them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are all these houses real gold?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The temples are covered with gold, of course,&rdquo; answered the
Captain, &ldquo;but the houses are only oricalchum. It&rsquo;s not quite so
expensive.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The learned gentleman, now very pale, stumbled along in a dazed way,
repeating&colon;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oricalchum&mdash;oricalchum.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;we can get
home in a minute, just by holding up the charm. Would you rather go back
now? We could easily come some other day without you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; he pleaded fervently; &ldquo;let the dream go
on. Please, please do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The High Ji&mdash;jimmy is perhaps weary with his magic
journey,&rdquo; said the Captain, noticing the blundering walk of the
learned gentleman; &ldquo;and we are yet very far from the Great Temple,
where today the Kings make sacrifice.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He stopped at the gate of a great enclosure. It seemed to be a sort of
park, for trees showed high above its brazen wall.</P>
<P>The party waited, and almost at once the Captain came back with one of
the hairy elephants and begged them to mount.</P>
<P>This they did.</P>
<P>It was a glorious ride. The elephant at the Zoo&mdash;to ride on him is
also glorious, but he
<PB ID="p217" N="217">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet217"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p218" N="218">
goes such a very little way, and then he goes back again, which is always
dull. But this great hairy beast went on and on and on along streets and
through squares and gardens. It was a glorious city; almost everything was
built of marble, red, or white, or black. Every now and then the party
crossed a bridge.</P>
<P>It was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the
town that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles,
alternately land and water, and over each of the water circles were the
bridges by which they had come.</P>
<P>And now they were in a great square. A vast building filled up one side
of it; it was overlaid with gold, and had a dome of silver. The rest of the
buildings round the square were of oricalchum. And it looked more splendid
than you can possibly imagine, standing up bold and shining in the
sunlight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You would like a bath,&rdquo; said the Captain, as the hairy
elephant went clumsily down on his knees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s customary, you
know, before entering the Presence. We have baths for men, women, horses,
and cattle. The High Class Baths are here. Our Father Poseidon gave us a
spring of hot water and one of cold.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children had never before bathed in baths of gold.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It feels very splendid,&rdquo; said Cyril, splashing.</P>
<PB ID="p219" N="219">
<P>&ldquo;At least, of course, it&rsquo;s not gold; it&rsquo;s
or&mdash;what&rsquo;s its name,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Hand over that
towel.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the
floor; one went down to them by steps.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Anthea timidly, when, very clean and
boiled&hyphen;looking, they all met in the flowery courtyard of the Public,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think all this seems much more like <EMPH>now</EMPH>
than Babylon or Egypt&mdash;? Oh, I forgot, you&rsquo;ve never been
there.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know a little of those nations, however,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I quite agree with you. A most discerning remark&mdash;my
dear,&rdquo; he added awkwardly; &ldquo;this city certainly seems to
indicate a far higher level of civilization than the Egyptian or
Babylonish, and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Now, boys, get out of
the way.&rdquo; He pushed through a little crowd of boys who were playing
with dried chestnuts fastened to a string.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ginger!&rdquo; remarked Robert, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re playing
conkers, just like the kids in Kentish Town Road!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they
were. The outermost wall was of brass, the Captain told them; the next,
which looked like silver, was covered with tin; and the innermost one was
of oricalchum.</P>
<P>And right in the middle was a wall of gold, with golden towers and
gates.</P>
<PB ID="p220" N="220">
<P>&ldquo;Behold the Temples of Poseidon,&rdquo; said the Captain.
&ldquo;It is not lawful for me to enter. I will await your return
here.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He told them what they ought to say, and the five people from Fitzroy
Street took hands and went forward. The golden gates slowly opened.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We are the children of the Sun,&rdquo; said Cyril, as he had been
told, &ldquo;and our High Priest, at least that&rsquo;s what the Captain
calls him. We have a different name for him at home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; asked a white&hyphen;robed man who stood
in the doorway with his arms extended.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ji&mdash;jimmy,&rdquo; replied Cyril, and he hesitated as Anthea
had done. It really did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a
gentleman. &ldquo;And we have come to speak with your Kings in the Temple
of Poseidon&mdash;does that word sound right?&rdquo; he whispered
anxiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
odd I can understand what you say to them, but not what they say to
you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Queen of Babylon found that too,&rdquo; said Cyril;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s part of the magic.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, what a dream!&rdquo; said the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>The white&hyphen;robed priest had been joined by others, and all were
bowing low.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;enter, Children of the Sun, with
your High Ji&mdash;jimmy.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p221" N="221">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet221"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p222" N="222">
<P>In an inner courtyard stood the Temple&mdash;all of silver, with gold
pinnacles and doors, and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men and
women. Also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal.</P>
<P>They went through the doors, and the priest led them up a stair into a
gallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The ten Kings are even now choosing the bull. It is not lawful
for me to behold,&rdquo; said the priest, and fell face downward on the
floor outside the gallery. The children looked down.</P>
<P>The roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals, and the
walls were lined with the favourite oricalchum.</P>
<P>At the far end of the Temple was a statue&hyphen;group, the like of
which no one living has ever seen.</P>
<P>It was of gold, and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof.
That figure was Poseidon, the Father of the City. He stood in a great
chariot drawn by six enormous horses, and round about it were a hundred
mermaids riding on dolphins.</P>
<P>Ten men, splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes, were
trying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that about
the floor of the Temple. The children held their breath, for the bulls
looked dangerous, and the great horned heads were swinging more and more
wildly.</P>
<P>Anthea did not like looking at the bulls.
<PB ID="p223" N="223">
She looked about the gallery, and noticed that another staircase led up
from it to a still higher story; also that a door led out into the open
air, where there seemed to be a balcony.</P>
<P>So that when a shout went up and Robert whispered, &ldquo;Got
him,&rdquo; and she looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out
of the Temple by whips, and the ten Kings following, one of them spurring
with his stick a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso,
she answered the boy&rsquo;s agitated, &ldquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t see
anything more,&rdquo; with&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes we can, there&rsquo;s an outside balcony.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they crowded out.</P>
<P>But very soon the girls crept back.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like sacrifices,&rdquo; Jane said. So she and
Anthea went and talked to the priest, who was no longer lying on his face,
but sitting on the top step mopping his forehead with his robe, for it was
a hot day.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special sacrifice,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;usually
it&rsquo;s only done on the justice days every five years and six years
alternately. And then they drink the cup of wine with some of the
bull&rsquo;s blood in it, and swear to judge truly. And they wear the
sacred blue robe, and put out all the Temple fires. But this today is
because the City&rsquo;s so upset by the odd noises from the sea, and the
god inside the big mountain speaking with his thunder&hyphen;voice. But all
that&rsquo;s happened so often before. If
<PB ID="p224" N="224">
anything could make <EMPH>me</EMPH> uneasy it wouldn&rsquo;t be
<EMPH>that</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What would it be?&rdquo; asked Jane kindly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It would be the Lemmings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who are they&mdash;enemies?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a sort of rat; and every year they come swimming
over from the country that no man knows, and stay here awhile, and then
swim away. This year they haven&rsquo;t come. You know rats won&rsquo;t
stay on a ship that&rsquo;s going to be wrecked. If anything horrible were
going to happen to us, it&rsquo;s my belief those Lemmings would know; and
that may be why they&rsquo;ve fought shy of us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What do you call this country?&rdquo; asked the Psammead,
suddenly putting its head out of its bag.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Atlantis,&rdquo; said the priest.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then I advise you to get on to the highest ground you can find. I
remember hearing something about a flood here. Look here,
you&rdquo;&mdash;it turned to Anthea; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get home. The
prospect&rsquo;s too wet for my whiskers.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The girls obediently went to find their brothers, who were leaning on
the balcony railings.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the learned gentleman?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There he is&mdash;below,&rdquo; said the priest, who had come
with them. &ldquo;Your High Ji&mdash;jimmy is with the Kings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The ten Kings were no longer alone. The learned gentleman&mdash;no one
had noticed how
<PB ID="p225" N="225">
he got there&mdash;stood with them on the steps of an altar, on which lay
the dead body of the black bull. All the rest of the courtyard was thick
with people, seemingly of all classes, and all were shouting, &ldquo;The
sea&mdash;the sea!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Be calm,&rdquo; said the most kingly of the Kings, he who had
lassoed the bull. &ldquo;Our town is strong against the thunders of the sea
and of the sky!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; whined the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go without <EMPH>him</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Anthea
firmly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; and waved to him.
He heard her, and began to come towards her through the crowd.</P>
<P>They could see from the balcony the sea&hyphen;captain edging his way
out from among the people. And his face was dead white, like paper.</P>
<P>&ldquo;To the hills!&rdquo; he cried in a loud and terrible voice. And
above his voice came another voice, louder, more terrible&mdash;the voice
of the sea.</P>
<P>The girls looked seaward.</P>
<P>Across the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled
towards the town. It was a wave, but a wave a hundred feet in height, a
wave that looked like a mountain&mdash;a wave rising higher and higher till
suddenly it seemed to break in two&mdash;one half of it rushed out to sea
again; the other&mdash;</P>
<PB ID="p226" N="226">
<P>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Anthea, &ldquo;the town&mdash;the poor
people!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all thousands of years ago, really,&rdquo; said Robert
but his voice trembled. They hid their eyes for a moment. They could not
bear to look down, for the wave had broken on the face of the town,
sweeping over the quays and docks, overwhelming the great storehouses and
factories, tearing gigantic stones from forts and bridges, and using them
as battering rams against the temples. Great ships were swept over the
roofs of the houses and dashed down half&hyphen;way up the hill among
ruined gardens and broken buildings. The water ground brown
fishing&hyphen;boats to powder on the golden roofs of Palaces.</P>
<P>Then the wave swept back towards the sea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; cried the Psammead fiercely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; said Jane, and the boys were ready&mdash;but
the learned gentleman had not come.</P>
<P>Then suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery,
crying&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I <EMPH>must</EMPH> see the end of the dream.&rdquo; He rushed up
the higher flight. The others followed him. They found themselves in a sort
of turret&mdash;roofed, but open to the air at the sides.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet, and as they rejoined
him the vast wave rushed back on the town. This time it rose
higher&mdash;destroyed more.</P>
<PB ID="p227" N="227">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet227"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p228" N="228">
<P>&ldquo;Come home,&rdquo; cried the Psammead;
&ldquo;<EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> the <EMPH>last</EMPH>, I know it is!
That&rsquo;s the last&mdash;over there.&rdquo; It pointed with a claw that
trembled.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; cried Jane, holding up the Amulet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I <EMPH>will see</EMPH> the end of the dream,&rdquo; cried the
learned gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see anything else if you do,&rdquo; said
Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>Jimmy</EMPH>!&rdquo; appealed Anthea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
<EMPH>never</EMPH> bring you out again!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never have the chance if you don&rsquo;t go
soon,&rdquo; said the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I <EMPH>will</EMPH> see the end of the dream,&rdquo; said the
learned gentleman obstinately.</P>
<P>The hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to the
mountains. And even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great white
peak, and then a faint flash of flame. Then the volcano began to throw up
its mysterious fiery inside parts. The earth trembled; ashes and sulphur
showered down; a rain of fine pumice&hyphen;stone fell like snow on all the
dry land. The elephants from the forest rushed up towards the peaks; great
lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain pools and rushed down
towards the sea. The snows melted and rushed down, first in avalanches,
then in roaring torrents. Great rocks cast up by the volcano fell splashing
in the sea miles away.</P>
<PB ID="p229" N="229">
<P>&ldquo;Oh, this is horrible!&rdquo; cried Anthea. &ldquo;Come home, come
home!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The end of the dream,&rdquo; gasped the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hold up the Amulet,&rdquo; cried the Psammead suddenly. The place
where they stood was now crowded with men and women, and the children were
strained tight against the parapet. The turret rocked and swayed; the wave
had reached the golden wall.</P>
<P>Jane held up the Amulet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried the Psammead, &ldquo;say the word!&rdquo;</P>
<P>And as Jane said it the Psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand of
the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>At the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all followed
him.</P>
<P>He turned to look back, and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste
of waters, with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire raging
from it.</P>
<P>He staggered back to his chair.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a ghastly dream!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re
here, my&mdash;er&mdash;dears. Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt your hand,&rdquo; said Anthea gently;
&ldquo;let me bind it up.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The hand was indeed bleeding rather badly.</P>
<P>The Psammead had crept back to its bag. All the children were very
white.</P>
<PB ID="p230" N="230">
<P>&ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; said the Psammead later on, &ldquo;will I go
into the Past with a grown&hyphen;up person! I will say for you four, you
do do as you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even find the Amulet,&rdquo; said Anthea later
still.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t; it wasn&rsquo;t there. Only the stone
it was made of was there. It fell on to a ship miles away that managed to
escape and got to Egypt. <EMPH>I</EMPH> could have told you
that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; said Anthea, and her voice was still
rather shaky. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You never asked me,&rdquo; said the Psammead very sulkily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the sort of chap to go shoving my oar in where
it&rsquo;s not wanted.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Mr Ji&hyphen;jimmy&rsquo;s friend will have something worth
having to put in his article now,&rdquo; said Cyril very much later
indeed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Robert sleepily. &ldquo;the learned
Ji&hyphen;jimmy will think it&rsquo;s a dream, and it&rsquo;s ten to one he
never tells the other chap a word about it at all.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert was quite right on both points. The learned gentleman did. And he
never did.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL AND JULIUS C&AElig;SAR</HEAD>
<P><HI>A GREAT</HI> City swept away by the sea, a beautiful country
devastated by an active volcano&mdash;these are not the sort of things you
see every day of the week. And when you do see them, no matter how many
other wonders you may have seen in your time, such sights are rather apt to
take your breath away. Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of
Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.</P>
<P>They remained in a breathless state for some days. The learned gentleman
seemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of what little breath
he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had. &ldquo;You would
hardly believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that anyone <EMPH>could</EMPH> have
such a detailed vision.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But Anthea could believe it, she said, quite easily.</P>
<P>He had ceased to talk about thought&hyphen;transference. He had now seen
too many wonders to believe that.</P>
<PB ID="p232" N="232">
<P>In consequence of their breathless condition none of the children
suggested any new excursions through the Amulet. Robert voiced the mood of
the others when he said that they were &ldquo;fed up&rdquo; with Amulet for
a bit. They undoubtedly were.</P>
<P>As for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out by the
terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in
obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the
Babylonian queen.</P>
<P>The children let it sleep. The danger of taking it about among strange
people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming more
and more plain.</P>
<P>And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from
Amulets or Psammeads. You can, for instance visit the Tower of London, the
Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, the Zoological Gardens, the
various Parks, the Museums at South Kensington, Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s
Exhibition of Waxworks, or the Botanical Gardens at Kew. You can go to Kew
by a river steamer&mdash;and this is the way that the children would have
gone if they had gone at all. Only they never did, because it was when they
were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what they should take
with them to eat and how much of it, and what the whole thing would cost,
that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to happen.</P>
<PB ID="p233" N="233">
<P>The children were sitting on a seat in St. James&rsquo;s Park. They had
been watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of
the seagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it. The pelican
thinks, very properly, that it hasn&rsquo;t the figure for games, so it
spends most of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it
won&rsquo;t play.</P>
<P>The breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little. Cyril,
who always wanted to understand all about everything, was turning things
over in his mind.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not; I&rsquo;m only thinking,&rdquo; he answered when
Robert asked him what he was so grumpy about. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
when I&rsquo;ve thought it all out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s about the Amulet I don&rsquo;t want to hear
it,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nobody asked you to,&rdquo; retorted Cyril mildly, &ldquo;and I
haven&rsquo;t finished my inside thinking about it yet. Let&rsquo;s go to
Kew in the meantime.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go in a steamer,&rdquo; said Robert; and the
girls laughed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;<EMPH>be</EMPH>
funny. I would.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, he was, rather,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think, Squirrel, if it hurts you so,&rdquo; said
Robert kindly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;or else talk about
Kew.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I want to see the palms there,&rdquo; said
<PB ID="p234" N="234">
Anthea hastily, &ldquo;to see if they&rsquo;re anything like the ones on
the island where we united the Cook and the Burglar by the Reverend
Half&hyphen;Curate.&rdquo;</P>
<P>All disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of recollections,
and &rsquo;Do you remember ...?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Have you forgotten
...?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;My hat!&rdquo; remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of
reminiscence ebbed a little; &ldquo;we have had some times.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We have that,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any more,&rdquo; said Jane
anxiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking about,&rdquo; Cyril replied; and
just then they heard the Little Black Girl sniff. She was quite close to
them.</P>
<P>She was not really a little black girl. She was shabby and not very
clean, and she had been crying so much that you could hardly see, through
the narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very blue her eyes were. It
was her dress that was black, and it was too big and too long for her, and
she wore a speckled black&hyphen;ribboned sailor hat that would have fitted
a much bigger head than her little flaxen one. And she stood looking at the
children and sniffing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Anthea, jumping up. &ldquo;Whatever is the
matter?&rdquo;</P>
<P>She put her hand on the little girl&rsquo;s arm. It was rudely shaken
off.</P>
<PB ID="p235" N="235">
<P>&ldquo;You leave me be,&rdquo; said the little girl. &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t doing nothing to you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; Anthea asked. &ldquo;Has some one been
hurting you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; said the little girl fiercely.
&ldquo;<EMPH>You&rsquo;re</EMPH> all right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; said Robert, pulling at Anthea&rsquo;s sleeve.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a nasty, rude little kid.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only dreadfully
unhappy. What is it?&rdquo; she asked again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>you&rsquo;re</EMPH> all right,&rdquo; the child
repeated; &ldquo;<EMPH>you</EMPH> ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to the
Union.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we take you home?&rdquo; said Anthea; and Jane added,
&ldquo;Where does your mother live?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t live nowheres&mdash;she&rsquo;s dead&mdash;so
now!&rdquo; said the little girl fiercely, in tones of miserable triumph.
Then she opened her swollen eyes widely, stamped her foot in fury, and ran
away. She ran no further than to the next bench, flung herself down there
and began to cry without even trying not to.</P>
<P>Anthea, quite at once, went to the little girl and put her arms as tight
as she could round the hunched&hyphen;up black figure.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry so, dear, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
she whispered under the brim of the large sailor hat, now very crooked
indeed. &ldquo;Tell Anthea all about it; Anthea&rsquo;ll help you. There,
there, dear, don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others stood at a distance. One or two passers&hyphen;by stared
curiously.</P>
<PB ID="p236" N="236">
<P>The child was now only crying part of the time; the rest of the time she
seemed to be talking to Anthea.</P>
<P>Presently Anthea beckoned Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo; she said in a furious whisper,
&ldquo;her father was a carpenter and he was a steady man, and never
touched a drop except on a Saturday, and he came up to London for work, and
there wasn&rsquo;t any, and then he died; and her name is Imogen, and
she&rsquo;s nine come next November. And now her mother&rsquo;s dead, and
she&rsquo;s to stay tonight with Mrs Shrobsall&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
landlady that&rsquo;s been kind&mdash;and tomorrow the Relieving Officer is
coming for her, and she&rsquo;s going into the Union; that means the
Workhouse. It&rsquo;s too terrible. What can we do?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask the learned gentleman,&rdquo; said Jane
brightly.</P>
<P>And as no one else could think of anything better the whole party walked
back to Fitzroy Street as fast as it could, the little girl holding tight
to Anthea&rsquo;s hand and now not crying any more, only sniffing
gently.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile that had
grown much easier to him than it used to be. They were quite at home in his
room now; it really seemed to welcome them. Even the mummy&hyphen;case
appeared to smile as if in its distant superior ancient Egyptian way it
were rather pleased to see them than not.</P>
<P>Anthea sat on the stairs with Imogen, who
<PB ID="p237" N="237">
was nine come next November, while the others went in and explained the
difficulty.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman listened with grave attention.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It really does seem rather rough luck,&rdquo; Cyril concluded,
&ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve often heard about rich people who wanted children
most awfully&mdash;though I know <EMPH>I</EMPH> never should&mdash;but they
do. There must be somebody who&rsquo;d be glad to have her.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Gipsies are awfully fond of children,&rdquo; Robert hopefully
said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always stealing them. Perhaps they&rsquo;d have
her.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite a nice little girl really,&rdquo; Jane added;
&ldquo;she was only rude at first because we looked jolly and happy, and
she wasn&rsquo;t. You understand that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, absently fingering a little blue image from
Egypt. &ldquo;I understand that very well. As you say, there must be some
home where she would be welcome.&rdquo; He scowled thoughtfully at the
little blue image.</P>
<P>Anthea outside thought the explanation was taking a very long time. She
was so busy trying to cheer and comfort the little black girl that she
never noticed the Psammead who, roused from sleep by her voice, had shaken
itself free of sand, and was coming crookedly up the stairs. It was close
to her before she saw it. She picked it up and settled it in her lap.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the black child. &ldquo;Is it a cat or a
organ&hyphen;monkey, or what?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p238" N="238">
<P>And then Anthea heard the learned gentleman say&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to have
her,&rdquo; and instantly she felt the Psammead begin to blow itself out as
it sat on her lap.</P>
<P>She jumped up lifting the Psammead in her skirt, and holding Imogen by
the hand, rushed into the learned gentleman&rsquo;s room.</P>
<P>&ldquo;At least let&rsquo;s keep together,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;All
hold hands&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The circle was like that formed for the Mulberry Bush or Ring o&rsquo;
Roses. And Anthea was only able to take part in it by holding in her teeth
the hem of her frock which, thus supported, formed a bag to hold the
Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is it a game?&rdquo; asked the learned gentleman feebly. No one
answered.</P>
<P>There was a moment of suspense; then came that curious
upside&hyphen;down, inside&hyphen;out sensation which one almost always
feels when transported from one place to another by magic. Also there was
that dizzy dimness of sight which comes on these occasions.</P>
<P>The mist cleared, the upside&hyphen;down, inside&hyphen;out sensation
subsided, and there stood the six in a ring, as before, only their twelve
feet, instead of standing on the carpet of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s
room, stood on green grass. Above them, instead of the dusky ceiling of the
Fitzroy Street floor, was a pale blue sky. And where the walls had
<PB ID="p239" N="239">
been and the painted mummy&hyphen;case, were tall dark green trees, oaks
and ashes, and in between the trees and under them tangled bushes and
creeping ivy. There were beech&hyphen;trees too, but there was nothing
under them but their own dead red drifted leaves, and here and there a
delicate green fern&hyphen;frond.</P>
<P>And there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though they
were playing Ring o&rsquo; Roses or the Mulberry Bush. Just six people hand
in hand in a wood. That sounds simple, but then you must remember that they
did not know <EMPH>where</EMPH> the wood was, and what&rsquo;s more, they
didn&rsquo;t know <EMPH>when</EMPH> then wood was. There was a curious sort
of feeling that made the learned gentleman say&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Another dream, dear me!&rdquo; and made the children almost
certain that they were in a time a very long while ago. As for little
Imogen, she said, &ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; and kept her mouth very much open
indeed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Cyril asked the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In Britain,&rdquo; said the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But when?&rdquo; asked Anthea anxiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;About the year fifty&hyphen;five before the year you reckon time
from,&rdquo; said the Psammead crossly. &ldquo;Is there anything else you
want to know?&rdquo; it added, sticking its head out of the bag formed by
Anthea&rsquo;s blue linen frock, and turning its snail&rsquo;s eyes to
right and left. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here before&mdash;it&rsquo;s very
little changed.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p240" N="240">
<P>&ldquo;Yes, but why here?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Your inconsiderate friend,&rdquo; the Psammead replied,
&ldquo;wished to find some home where they would be glad to have that
unattractive and immature female human being whom you have picked
up&mdash;gracious knows how. In Megatherium days properly brought&hyphen;up
children didn&rsquo;t talk to shabby strangers in parks. Your thoughtless
friend wanted a place where some one would be glad to have this undesirable
stranger. And now here you are!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see we are,&rdquo; said Anthea patiently, looking round on the
tall gloom of the forest. &ldquo;But why <EMPH>here</EMPH>? Why
<EMPH>now</EMPH>?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose anyone would want a child like that in
<EMPH>your</EMPH> times&mdash;in <EMPH>your</EMPH> towns?&rdquo; said the
Psammead in irritated tones. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your country into such
a mess that there&rsquo;s no room for half your children&mdash;and no one
to want them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our doing, you know,&rdquo; said Anthea
gently.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything,&rdquo;
said the Psammead still more crossly, &ldquo;when every one knows how damp
and foggy Ancient Britain was.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, take my coat,&rdquo; said Robert, taking it off. Anthea
spread the coat on the ground and, putting the Psammead on it, folded it
round so that only the eyes and furry ears showed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said comfortingly. &ldquo;Now if it
<PB ID="p241" N="241">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet241"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p242" N="242">
does begin to look like rain, I can cover you up in a minute. Now what are
we to do?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others who had stopped holding hands crowded round to hear the
answer to this question. Imogen whispered in an awed tone&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the organ monkey talk neither! I thought it was only
parrots!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; replied the Psammead. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what
you do!&rdquo; And it drew head and ears into the tweed covering of
Robert&rsquo;s coat.</P>
<P>The others looked at each other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a dream,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman
hopefully; &ldquo;something is sure to happen if we can prevent ourselves
from waking up.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And sure enough, something did.</P>
<P>The brooding silence of the dark forest was broken by the laughter of
children and the sound of voices.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a dream,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman to
Jane, who hung back; &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t go with the tide of a
dream&mdash;if you resist&mdash;you wake up, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a sort of break in the undergrowth that was like a silly
person&rsquo;s idea of a path. They went along this in Indian file, the
learned gentleman leading.</P>
<P>Quite soon they came to a large clearing in the forest. There were a
number of houses&mdash;huts perhaps you would have called them&mdash;with a
sort of mud and wood fence.</P>
<PB ID="p243" N="243">
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the old Egyptian town,&rdquo; whispered
Anthea.</P>
<P>And it was, rather.</P>
<P>Some children, with no clothes on at all, were playing what looked like
Ring o&rsquo; Roses or Mulberry Bush. That is to say, they were dancing
round in a ring, holding hands. On a grassy bank several women, dressed in
blue and white robes and tunics of beast&hyphen;skins sat watching the
playing children.</P>
<P>The children from Fitzroy Street stood on the fringe of the forest
looking at the games. One woman with long, fair braided hair sat a little
apart from the others, and there was a look in her eyes as she followed the
play of the children that made Anthea feel sad and sorry.</P>
<P>&ldquo;None of those little girls is her own little girl,&rdquo; thought
Anthea.</P>
<P>The little black&hyphen;clad London child pulled at Anthea&rsquo;s
sleeve.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that one there&mdash;she&rsquo;s
precious like mother; mother&rsquo;s &rsquo;air was somethink lovely, when
she &rsquo;ad time to comb it out. Mother wouldn&rsquo;t never
a&hyphen;beat me if she&rsquo;d lived &rsquo;ere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
suppose there&rsquo;s e&rsquo;er a public nearer than Epping, do you,
Miss?&rdquo;</P>
<P>In her eagerness the child had stepped out of the shelter of the forest.
The sad&hyphen;eyed woman saw her. She stood up, her thin face lighted up
with a radiance like sunrise, her long, lean arms stretched towards the
London child.</P>
<PB ID="p244" N="244">
<P>&ldquo;Imogen!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;at least the word was more like
that than any other word&mdash;&ldquo;Imogen!&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a moment of great silence; the naked children paused in their
play, the women on the bank stared anxiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, it <EMPH>is</EMPH> mother&mdash;it <EMPH>is</EMPH>!&rdquo;
cried Imogen&hyphen;from&hyphen;London, and rushed across the cleared
space. She and her mother clung together&mdash;so closely, so strongly that
they stood an instant like a statue carved in stone.</P>
<P>Then the women crowded round.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>is</EMPH> my Imogen!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;Oh
it is! And she wasn&rsquo;t eaten by wolves. She&rsquo;s come back to me.
Tell me, my darling, how did you escape? Where have you been? Who has fed
and clothed you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothink,&rdquo; said Imogen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; whispered the women who crowded round,
&ldquo;the terror of the wolves has turned her brain.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you know <EMPH>me</EMPH>?&rdquo; said the fair&hyphen;haired
woman.</P>
<P>And Imogen, clinging with black&hyphen;clothed arms to the bare neck,
answered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes, mother, I know <EMPH>you</EMPH> right
&rsquo;nough.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is it? What do they say?&rdquo; the learned gentleman asked
anxiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You wished to come where some one wanted the child,&rdquo; said
the Psammead. &ldquo;The child says this is her mother.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And the mother?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can see,&rdquo; said the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But is she really? Her child, I mean?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p245" N="245">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet245"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p246" N="246">
<P>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said the Psammead; &ldquo;but each one fills
the empty place in the other&rsquo;s heart. It is enough.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, &ldquo;this is a good
dream. I wish the child might stay in the dream.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The Psammead blew itself out and granted the wish. So Imogen&rsquo;s
future was assured. She had found some one to want her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If only all the children that no one wants,&rdquo; began the
learned gentleman&mdash;but the woman interrupted. She came towards
them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Welcome, all!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I am the Queen, and my
child tells me that you have befriended her; and this I well believe,
looking on your faces. Your garb is strange, but faces I can read. The
child is bewitched, I see that well, but in this she speaks truth. Is it
not so?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children said it wasn&rsquo;t worth mentioning.</P>
<P>I wish you could have seen all the honours and kindnesses lavished on
the children and the learned gentleman by those ancient Britons. You would
have thought, to see them, that a child was something to make a fuss about,
not a bit of rubbish to be hustled about the streets and hidden away in the
workhouse. It wasn&rsquo;t as grand as the entertainment at Babylon, but
somehow it was more satisfying.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I think you children have some wonderful
<PB ID="p247" N="247">
influence on me,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman. &ldquo;I never dreamed
such dreams before I knew you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was when they were alone that night under the stars where the Britons
had spread a heap of dried fern for them to sleep on, that Cyril spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve made it all right for
Imogen, and had a jolly good time. I vote we get home again before the
fighting begins.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What fighting?&rdquo; asked Jane sleepily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, Julius C&aelig;sar, you little goat,&rdquo; replied her kind
brother. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that if this is the year
fifty&hyphen;five, Julius C&aelig;sar may happen at any moment.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I thought you liked C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So I do&mdash;in the history. But that&rsquo;s different from
being killed by his soldiers.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If we saw C&aelig;sar we might persuade him not to,&rdquo; said
Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>You</EMPH> persuade <EMPH>C&aelig;sar</EMPH>,&rdquo; Robert
laughed.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman, before anyone could stop him, said, &ldquo;I only
wish we could see C&aelig;sar some time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And, of course, in just the little time the Psammead took to blow itself
out for wish&hyphen;giving, the five, or six counting the Psammead, found
themselves in C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s camp, just outside C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
tent. And they saw C&aelig;sar. The Psammead must have taken advantage of
the loose wording of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s wish, for it was not
<PB ID="p248" N="248">
the same time of day as that on which the wish had been uttered among the
dried ferns. It was sunset, and the great man sat on a chair outside his
tent gazing over the sea towards Britain&mdash;every one knew without being
told that it was towards Britain. Two golden eagles on the top of posts
stood on each side of the tent, and on the flaps of the tent which was very
gorgeous to look at were the letters S.P.Q.R.</P>
<P>The great man turned unchanged on the newcomers the august glance that
he had turned on the violet waters of the Channel. Though they had suddenly
appeared out of nothing, C&aelig;sar never showed by the faintest movement
of an eyelid, by the least tightening of that firm mouth, that they were
not some long expected embassy. He waved a calm hand towards the sentinels,
who sprang weapons in hand towards the newcomers.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; he said in a voice that thrilled like music.
&ldquo;Since when has C&aelig;sar feared children and students?&rdquo;</P>
<P>To the children he seemed to speak in the only language they knew; but
the learned gentleman heard&mdash;in rather a strange accent, but quite
intelligibly&mdash;the lips of C&aelig;sar speaking in the Latin tongue,
and in that tongue, a little stiffly, he answered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is a dream, O C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A dream?&rdquo; repeated C&aelig;sar. &ldquo;What is a
dream?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p249" N="249">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet249"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p250" N="250">
<P>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sort of magic. We
come out of another time and another place.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering
Britain,&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a poor little place, not
worth bothering about.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Are you from Britain?&rdquo; the General asked. &ldquo;Your
clothes are uncouth, but well woven, and your hair is short as the hair of
Roman citizens, not long like the hair of barbarians, yet such I deem you
to be.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Jane with angry eagerness;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re not barbarians at all. We come from the country where
the sun never sets, and we&rsquo;ve read about you in books; and our
country&rsquo;s full of fine things&mdash;St Paul&rsquo;s, and the Tower of
London, and Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s Exhibition, and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then the others stopped her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; said Robert in a bitter
undertone.</P>
<P>C&aelig;sar looked at the children a moment in silence. Then he called a
soldier and spoke with him apart. Then he said aloud&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You three elder children may go where you will within the camp.
Few children are privileged to see the camp of C&aelig;sar. The student and
the smaller girl&hyphen;child will remain here with me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Nobody liked this; but when C&aelig;sar said a thing that thing was so,
and there was an end to it. So the three went.</P>
<PB ID="p251" N="251">
<P>Left alone with Jane and the learned gentleman, the great Roman found it
easy enough to turn them inside out. But it was not easy, even for him, to
make head or tail of the insides of their minds when he had got at
them.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman insisted that the whole thing was a dream, and
refused to talk much, on the ground that if he did he would wake up.</P>
<P>Jane, closely questioned, was full of information about railways,
electric lights, balloons, men&hyphen;of&hyphen;war, cannons, and
dynamite.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And do they fight with swords?&rdquo; asked the General.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, swords and guns and cannons.&rdquo;</P>
<P>C&aelig;sar wanted to know what guns were.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You fire them,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;and they go bang, and
people fall down dead.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what are guns like?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane found them hard to describe.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But Robert has a toy one in his pocket,&rdquo; she said. So the
others were recalled.</P>
<P>The boys explained the pistol to C&aelig;sar very fully, and he looked
at it with the greatest interest. It was a two&hyphen;shilling pistol, the
one that had done such good service in the old Egyptian village.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I shall cause guns to be made,&rdquo; said C&aelig;sar,
&ldquo;and you will be detained till I know whether you have spoken the
truth. I had just decided that Britain was not worth the bother of
invading. But what
<PB ID="p252" N="252">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet252"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p253" N="253">
you tell me decides me that it is very much worth while.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Britain
is just a savage sort of island&mdash;all fogs and trees and big rivers.
But the people are kind. We know a little girl there named Imogen. And
it&rsquo;s no use your making guns because you can&rsquo;t fire them
without gunpowder, and that won&rsquo;t be invented for hundreds of years,
and we don&rsquo;t know how to make it, and we can&rsquo;t tell you. Do go
straight home, dear C&aelig;sar, and let poor little Britain
alone.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But this other girl&hyphen;child says&mdash;&rdquo; said
C&aelig;sar.</P>
<P>&ldquo;All Jane&rsquo;s been telling you is what it&rsquo;s going to
be,&rdquo; Anthea interrupted, &ldquo;hundreds and hundreds of years from
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The little one is a prophetess, eh?&rdquo; said C&aelig;sar, with
a whimsical look. &ldquo;Rather young for the business, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You can call her a prophetess if you like,&rdquo; said Cyril,
&ldquo;but what Anthea says is true.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Anthea?&rdquo; said C&aelig;sar. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Greek
name.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Cyril, worriedly. &ldquo;I say, I do
wish you&rsquo;d give up this idea of conquering Britain. It&rsquo;s not
worth while, really it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said C&aelig;sar, &ldquo;what
you&rsquo;ve told me has decided me to go, if it&rsquo;s only to find out
what Britain is really like. Guards, detain these children.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p254" N="254">
<P>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;before the guards begin
detaining. We had enough of that in Babylon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane held up the Amulet away from the sunset, and said the word. The
learned gentleman was pushed through and the others more quickly than ever
before passed through the arch back into their own times and the quiet
dusty sitting&hyphen;room of the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>It is a curious fact that when C&aelig;sar was encamped on the coast of
Gaul&mdash;somewhere near Boulogne it was, I believe&mdash;he was sitting
before his tent in the glow of the sunset, looking out over the violet
waters of the English Channel. Suddenly he started, rubbed his eyes, and
called his secretary. The young man came quickly from within the tent.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Marcus,&rdquo; said C&aelig;sar. &ldquo;I have dreamed a very
wonderful dream. Some of it I forget, but I remember enough to decide what
was not before determined. Tomorrow the ships that have been brought round
from the Ligeris shall be provisioned. We shall sail for this
three&hyphen;cornered island. First, we will take but two legions. This, if
what we have heard be true, should suffice. But if my dream be true, then a
hundred legions will not suffice. For the dream I dreamed was the most
wonderful that ever tormented the brain even of C&aelig;sar. And
<PB ID="p255" N="255">
C&aelig;sar has dreamed some strange things in his time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And if you hadn&rsquo;t told C&aelig;sar all that about how
things are now, he&rsquo;d never have invaded Britain,&rdquo; said Robert
to Jane as they sat down to tea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said Anthea, pouring out; &ldquo;it was all
settled hundreds of years ago.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;Jam, please. This
about time being only a thingummy of thought is very confusIng. If
everything happens at the same time&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>can&rsquo;t</EMPH>!&rdquo; said Anthea stoutly,
&ldquo;the present&rsquo;s the present and the past&rsquo;s the
past.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;When we were in the Past the present was the future. Now
then!&rdquo; he added triumphantly.</P>
<P>And Anthea could not deny it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should have liked to see more of the camp,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, we didn&rsquo;t get much for our money&mdash;but Imogen is
happy, that&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;We left her happy
in the Past. I&rsquo;ve often seen about people being happy in the Past, in
poetry books. I see what it means now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad idea,&rdquo; said the Psammead sleepily,
putting its head out of its bag and taking it in again suddenly,
&ldquo;being left in the Past.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Every one remembered this afterwards, when&mdash;</P>

<PB ID="p256" N="256">
<DIV0 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEFORE PHARAOH</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> was the day after the adventure of Julius C&aelig;sar and
the Little Black Girl that Cyril, bursting into the bathroom to wash his
hands for dinner (you have no idea how dirty they were, for he had been
playing shipwrecked mariners all the morning on the leads at the back of
the house, where the water&hyphen;cistern is), found Anthea leaning her
elbows on the edge of the bath, and crying steadily into it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, with brotherly concern,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s up now? Dinner&rsquo;ll be cold before you&rsquo;ve got
enough salt&hyphen;water for a bath.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; said Anthea fiercely. &ldquo;I hate you! I hate
everybody!&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a stricken pause.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cyril tamely.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nobody ever does know anything,&rdquo; sobbed Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were waxy. I thought you&rsquo;d just
hurt your fingers with the tap
<PB ID="p257" N="257">
again like you did last week,&rdquo; Cyril carefully explained.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;fingers!&rdquo; sneered Anthea through her sniffs.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here, drop it, Panther,&rdquo; he said uncomfortably. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t been having a row or anything?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wash your horrid hands, for
goodness&rsquo; sake, if that&rsquo;s what you came for, or go.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Anthea was so seldom cross that when she was cross the others were
always more surprised than angry.</P>
<P>Cyril edged along the side of the bath and stood beside her. He put his
hand on her arm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dry up, do,&rdquo; he said, rather tenderly for him. And, finding
that though she did not at once take his advice she did not seem to resent
it, he put his arm awkwardly across her shoulders and rubbed his head
against her ear.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, in the tone of one administering a
priceless cure for all possible sorrows. &ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Promise you won&rsquo;t laugh?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel laughish myself,&rdquo; said Cyril,
dismally.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Anthea, leaning her ear against his head,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s Mother.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Mother?&rdquo; asked Cyril, with
apparent want of sympathy. &ldquo;she was all right in her letter this
morning.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p258" N="258">
<P>&ldquo;Yes; but I want her so.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one,&rdquo; said Cyril briefly, and the
brevity of his tone admitted a good deal.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;I know. We all want her all
the time. But I want her now most dreadfully, awfully much. I never wanted
anything so much. That Imogen child&mdash;the way the ancient British Queen
cuddled her up! And Imogen wasn&rsquo;t me, and the Queen wasn&rsquo;t
Mother. And then her letter this morning! And about The Lamb liking the
salt bathing! And she bathed him in this very bath the night before she
went away&mdash;oh, oh, oh!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril thumped her on the back.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know my inside thinking that
I was doing? Well, that was partly about Mother. We&rsquo;ll soon get her
back. If you&rsquo;ll chuck it, like a sensible kid, and wash your face,
I&rsquo;ll tell you about it. That&rsquo;s right. You let me get to the
tap. Can&rsquo;t you stop crying? Shall I put the door&hyphen;key down your
back?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for noses,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
not a kid any more than you are,&rdquo; but she laughed a little, and her
mouth began to get back into its proper shape. You know what an odd shape
your mouth gets into when you cry in earnest.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cyril, working the soap round and round
between his hands in a thick slime of grey soapsuds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
<PB ID="p259" N="259">
thinking. We&rsquo;ve only just <EMPH>played</EMPH> with the Amulet so far.
We&rsquo;ve got to <EMPH>work</EMPH> it now&mdash;work it for all
it&rsquo;s worth. And it isn&rsquo;t only Mother either. There&rsquo;s
Father out there all among the fighting. I don&rsquo;t howl about it, but I
<EMPH>think</EMPH>&mdash;Oh, bother the soap!&rdquo; The grey&hyphen;lined
soap had squirted out under the pressure of his fingers, and had hit
Anthea&rsquo;s chin with as much force as though it had been shot from a
catapult.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; she said regretfully, &ldquo;now I shall have
to wash my face.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have had to do that anyway,&rdquo; said Cyril with
conviction. &ldquo;Now, my idea&rsquo;s this. You know
missionaries?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, who did not know a single one.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, they always take the savages beads and brandy, and stays,
and hats, and braces, and really useful things&mdash;things the savages
haven&rsquo;t got, and never heard about. And the savages love them for
their kind generousness, and give them pearls, and shells, and ivory, and
cassowaries. And that&rsquo;s the way&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wait a sec,&rdquo; said Anthea, splashing. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
hear what you&rsquo;re saying. Shells and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shells, and things like that. The great thing is to get people to
love you by being generous. And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do.
Next time we go into the Past we&rsquo;ll regularly fit out the expedition.
You remember how
<PB ID="p260" N="260">
the Babylonian Queen froze on to that pocket&hyphen;book? Well, we&rsquo;ll
take things like that. And offer them in exchange for a sight of the
Amulet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A sight of it is not much good.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, silly. But, don&rsquo;t you see, when we&rsquo;ve seen it we
shall know where it is, and we can go and take it in the night when
everybody is asleep.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be stealing, would it?&rdquo; said Anthea
thoughtfully, &ldquo;because it will be such an awfully long time ago when
we do it. Oh, there&rsquo;s that bell again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>As soon as dinner was eaten (it was tinned salmon and lettuce, and a jam
tart), and the cloth cleared away, the idea was explained to the others,
and the Psammead was aroused from sand, and asked what it thought would be
good merchandise with which to buy the affection of say, the Ancient
Egyptians, and whether it thought the Amulet was likely to be found in the
Court of Pharaoh.</P>
<P>But it shook its head, and shot out its snail&rsquo;s eyes
hopelessly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to play in this game,&rdquo; it said.
&ldquo;Of course I <EMPH>could</EMPH> find out in a minute where the thing
was, only I mayn&rsquo;t. But I may go so far as to own that your idea of
taking things with you isn&rsquo;t a bad one. And I shouldn&rsquo;t show
them all at once. Take small things and conceal them craftily about your
persons.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p261" N="261">
<P>This advice seemed good. Soon the table was littered over with things
which the children thought likely to interest the Ancient Egyptians. Anthea
brought dolls, puzzle blocks, a wooden tea&hyphen;service, a green leather
case with <FOREIGN LANG="fre">N&eacute;cessaire</FOREIGN> written on it in
gold letters. Aunt Emma had once given it to Anthea, and it had then
contained scissors, penknife, bodkin, stiletto, thimble, corkscrew, and
glove&hyphen;buttoner. The scissors, knife, and thimble, and penknife were,
of course, lost, but the other things were there and as good as new. Cyril
contributed lead soldiers, a cannon, a catapult, a tin&hyphen;opener, a
tie&hyphen;clip, and a tennis ball, and a padlock&mdash;no key. Robert
collected a candle (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they ever saw a
self&hyphen;fitting paraffin one,&rdquo; he said), a penny Japanese
pin&hyphen;tray, a rubber stamp with his father&rsquo;s name and address on
it, and a piece of putty.</P>
<P>Jane added a key&hyphen;ring, the brass handle of a poker, a pot that
had held cold&hyphen;cream, a smoked pearl button off her winter coat, and
a key&mdash;no lock.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take all this rubbish,&rdquo; said Robert, with
some scorn. &ldquo;We must just each choose one thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The afternoon passed very agreeably in the attempt to choose from the
table the four most suitable objects. But the four children could not agree
what was suitable, and at last Cyril said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here, let&rsquo;s each be blindfolded and
<PB ID="p262" N="262">
reach out, and the first thing you touch you stick to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This was done.</P>
<P>Cyril touched the padlock.</P>
<P>Anthea got the <FOREIGN LANG="fre">N&eacute;cessaire</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>Robert clutched the candle.</P>
<P>Jane picked up the tie&hyphen;clip.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe Ancient Egyptians wore ties.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s
luckier not to really choose. In the stories it&rsquo;s always the thing
the wood&hyphen;cutter&rsquo;s son picks up in the forest, and almost
throws away because he thinks it&rsquo;s no good, that turns out to be the
magic thing in the end; or else some one&rsquo;s lost it, and he is
rewarded with the hand of the King&rsquo;s daughter in marriage.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any hands in marriage, thank you.&rdquo; said
Cyril firmly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nor yet me,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the end
of the adventures when it comes to the marriage hands.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Are</EMPH> we ready?&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It <EMPH>is</EMPH> Egypt we&rsquo;re going to, isn&rsquo;t
it?&mdash;nice Egypt?&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go anywhere I
don&rsquo;t know about&mdash;like that dreadful big&hyphen;wavy
burning&hyphen;mountain city,&rdquo; she insisted.</P>
<P>Then the Psammead was coaxed into its bag.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Cyril suddenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather sick
of kings. And people notice you so in palaces. Besides the Amulet&rsquo;s
sure to be in
<PB ID="p263" N="263">
a Temple. Let&rsquo;s just go among the common people, and try to work
ourselves up by degrees. We might get taken on as Temple
assistants.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Like beadles,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;or vergers. They must
have splendid chances of stealing the Temple treasures.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; was the general rejoinder. The charm was held up.
It grew big once again, and once again the warm golden Eastern light glowed
softly beyond it.</P>
<P>As the children stepped through it loud and furious voices rang in their
ears. They went suddenly from the quiet of Fitzroy Street
dining&hyphen;room into a very angry Eastern crowd, a crowd much too angry
to notice them. They edged through it to the wall of a house and stood
there. The crowd was of men, women, and children. They were of all sorts of
complexions, and pictures of them might have been coloured by any child
with a shilling paint&hyphen;box. The colours that child would have used
for complexions would have been yellow ochre, red ochre, light red, sepia,
and indian ink. But their faces were painted already&mdash;black eyebrows
and lashes, and some red lips. The women wore a sort of pinafore with
shoulder straps, and loose things wound round their heads and shoulders.
The men wore very little clothing&mdash;for they were the working
people&mdash;and the Egyptian boys and girls wore nothing at all, unless
you count the little ornaments hung on chains
<PB ID="p264" N="264">
round their necks and waists. The children saw all this before they could
hear anything distinctly. Every one was shouting so.</P>
<P>But a voice sounded above the other voices, and presently it was
speaking in a silence.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Comrades and fellow workers,&rdquo; it said, and it was the voice
of a tall, coppery&hyphen;coloured man who had climbed into a chariot that
had been stopped by the crowd. Its owner had bolted, muttering something
about calling the Guards, and now the man spoke from it. &ldquo;Comrades
and fellow workers, how long are we to endure the tyranny of our masters,
who live in idleness and luxury on the fruit of our toil? They only give us
a bare subsistence wage, and they live on the fat of the land. We labour
all our lives to keep them in wanton luxury. Let us make an end of
it!&rdquo;</P>
<P>A roar of applause answered him.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How are you going to do it?&rdquo; cried a voice.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You look out,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll get
yourself into trouble.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard almost every single word of that,&rdquo;
whispered Robert, &ldquo;in Hyde Park last Sunday!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let us strike for more bread and onions and beer, and a longer
mid&hyphen;day rest,&rdquo; the speaker went on. &ldquo;You are tired, you
are hungry, you are thirsty. You are poor, your wives and children are
pining for food. The barns of the rich are full to bursting
<PB ID="p265" N="265">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet265"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p266" N="266">
with the corn we want, the corn our labour has grown. To the
granaries!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;To the granaries!&rdquo; cried half the crowd; but another voice
shouted clear above the tumult, &ldquo;To Pharaoh! To the King! Let&rsquo;s
present a petition to the King! He will listen to the voice of the
oppressed!&rdquo;</P>
<P>For a moment the crowd swayed one way and another&mdash;first towards
the granaries and then towards the palace. Then, with a rush like that of
an imprisoned torrent suddenly set free, it surged along the street towards
the palace, and the children were carried with it. Anthea found it
difficult to keep the Psammead from being squeezed very uncomfortably.</P>
<P>The crowd swept through the streets of dull&hyphen;looking houses with
few windows, very high up, across the market where people were not buying
but exchanging goods. In a momentary pause Robert saw a basket of onions
exchanged for a hair comb and five fish for a string of beads. The people
in the market seemed better off than those in the crowd; they had finer
clothes, and more of them. They were the kind of people who, nowadays,
would have lived at Brixton or Brockley.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble now?&rdquo; a languid, large&hyphen;eyed
lady in a crimped, half&hyphen;transparent linen dress, with her black hair
very much braided and puffed out, asked of a date&hyphen;seller.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, the working&hyphen;men&mdash;discontented as
<PB ID="p267" N="267">
usual,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;Listen to them. Anyone would think
it mattered whether they had a little more or less to eat. Dregs of
society!&rdquo; said the date&hyphen;seller.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Scum!&rdquo; said the lady.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard <EMPH>that</EMPH> before, too,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>At that moment the voice of the crowd changed, from anger to doubt, from
doubt to fear. There were other voices shouting; they shouted defiance and
menace, and they came nearer very quickly. There was the rattle of wheels
and the pounding of hoofs. A voice shouted, &ldquo;Guards!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Guards! The Guards!&rdquo; shouted another voice, and the
crowd of workmen took up the cry. &ldquo;The Guards! Pharaoh&rsquo;s
Guards!&rdquo; And swaying a little once more, the crowd hung for a moment
as it were balanced. Then as the trampling hoofs came nearer the workmen
fled dispersed, up alleys and into the courts of houses, and the Guards in
their embossed leather chariots swept down the street at the gallop, their
wheels clattering over the stones, and their dark&hyphen;coloured, blue
tunics blown open and back with the wind of their going.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So <EMPH>that</EMPH> riot&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said the
crimped&hyphen;linen&hyphen;dressed lady; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a blessing!
And did you notice the Captain of the Guard? What a very handsome man he
was, to be sure!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The four children had taken advantage of the moment&rsquo;s pause before
the crowd turned
<PB ID="p268" N="268">
to fly to edge themselves and drag each other into an arched doorway.</P>
<P>Now they each drew a long breath and looked at the others.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re well out of <EMPH>that</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;but I do wish the poor men
hadn&rsquo;t been driven back before they could get to the King. He might
have done something for them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not if he was the one in the Bible he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Jane. &ldquo;He had a hard heart.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, that was the Moses one,&rdquo; Anthea explained. &ldquo;The
Joseph one was quite different. I should like to see Pharaoh&rsquo;s house.
I wonder whether it&rsquo;s like the Egyptian Court in the Crystal
Palace.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I thought we decided to try to get taken on in a Temple,&rdquo;
said Cyril in injured tones.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;ve got to know some one first. Couldn&rsquo;t
we make friends with a Temple doorkeeper&mdash;we might give him the
padlock or something. I wonder which are temples and which are
palaces,&rdquo; Robert added, glancing across the market&hyphen;place to
where an enormous gateway with huge side buildings towered towards the sky.
To right and left of it were other buildings only a little less
magnificent.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Did you wish to seek out the Temple of
Amen&hyphen;R&amacr;?&rdquo; asked a soft voice behind them, &ldquo;or the
Temple of Mut, or the Temple of Khonsu?&rdquo;</P>
<P>They turned to find beside them a young
<PB ID="p269" N="269">
man. He was shaved clean from head to foot, and on his feet were light
papyrus sandals. He was clothed in a linen tunic of white, embroidered
heavily in colours. He was gay with anklets, bracelets, and armlets of
gold, richly inlaid. He wore a ring on his finger, and he had a short
jacket of gold embroidery something like the Zouave soldiers wear, and on
his neck was a gold collar with many amulets hanging from it. But among the
amulets the children could see none like theirs.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter which Temple,&rdquo; said Cyril
frankly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tell me your mission,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I am a
divine father of the Temple of Amen&hyphen;R&amacr; and perhaps I can help
you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve come from the great
Empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I thought somehow that you&rsquo;d come from some odd,
out&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;way spot,&rdquo; said the priest with
courtesy.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve seen a good many palaces. We thought we should
like to see a Temple, for a change,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>The Psammead stirred uneasily in its embroidered bag.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Have you brought gifts to the Temple?&rdquo; asked the priest
cautiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We <EMPH>have</EMPH> got some gifts,&rdquo; said Cyril with equal
caution. &ldquo;You see there&rsquo;s magic mixed up in it. So we
can&rsquo;t tell you everything. But we don&rsquo;t want to give our gifts
for nothing.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p270" N="270">
<P>&ldquo;Beware how you insult the god,&rdquo; said the priest sternly.
&ldquo;I also can do magic. I can make a waxen image of you, and I can say
words which, as the wax image melts before the fire, will make you dwindle
away and at last perish miserably.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Cyril stoutly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nothing.
<EMPH>I</EMPH> can make <EMPH>fire</EMPH> itself!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should jolly well like to see you do it,&rdquo; said the priest
unbelievingly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, you shall,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;nothing easier. Just
stand close round me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you need no preparation&mdash;no fasting, no
incantations?&rdquo; The priest&rsquo;s tone was incredulous.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The incantation&rsquo;s quite short,&rdquo; said Cyril, taking
the hint; &ldquo;and as for fasting, it&rsquo;s not needed in
<EMPH>my</EMPH> sort of magic. Union Jack, Printing Press, Gunpowder, Rule
Britannia! Come, Fire, at the end of this little stick!&rdquo;</P>
<P>He had pulled a match from his pocket, and as he ended the incantation
which contained no words that it seemed likely the Egyptian had ever heard
he stooped in the little crowd of his relations and the priest and struck
the match on his boot. He stood up, shielding the flame with one hand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; he said, with modest pride. &ldquo;Here, take it into
your hand.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said the priest, swiftly backing.
&ldquo;Can you do that again?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then come with me to the great double
<PB ID="p271" N="271">
house of Pharaoh. He loves good magic, and he will raise you to honour and
glory. There&rsquo;s no need of secrets between initiates,&rdquo; he went
on confidentially. &ldquo;The fact is, I am out of favour at present owing
to a little matter of failure of prophecy. I told him a beautiful princess
would be sent to him from Syria, and, lo! a woman thirty years old arrived.
But she <EMPH>was</EMPH> a beautiful woman not so long ago. Time is only a
mode of thought, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children thrilled to the familiar words.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So you know that too, do you?&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is part of the mystery of all magic, is it not?&rdquo; said
the priest. &ldquo;Now if I bring you to Pharaoh the little unpleasantness
I spoke of will be forgotten. And I will ask Pharaoh, the Great House, Son
of the Sun, and Lord of the South and North, to decree that you shall lodge
in the Temple. Then you can have a good look round, and teach me your
magic. And I will teach you mine.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This idea seemed good&mdash;at least it was better than any other which
at that moment occurred to anybody, so they followed the priest through the
city.</P>
<P>The streets were very narrow and dirty. The best houses, the priest
explained, were built within walls twenty to twenty&hyphen;five feet high,
and such windows as showed in the walls were very high up. The tops of
palm&hyphen;trees showed above the walls. The poor
<PB ID="p272" N="272">
people&rsquo;s houses were little square huts with a door and two windows,
and smoke coming out of a hole in the back.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The poor Egyptians haven&rsquo;t improved so very much in their
building since the first time we came to Egypt,&rdquo; whispered Cyril to
Anthea.</P>
<P>The huts were roofed with palm branches, and everywhere there were
chickens, and goats, and little naked children kicking about in the yellow
dust. On one roof was a goat, who had climbed up and was eating the dry
palm&hyphen;leaves with snorts and head&hyphen;tossings of delight. Over
every house door was some sort of figure or shape.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Amulets,&rdquo; the priest explained, &ldquo;to keep off the evil
eye.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of your &lsquo;nice Egypt,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Robert whispered to Jane; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simply not a patch on
Babylon.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, you wait till you see the palace,&rdquo; Jane whispered
back.</P>
<P>The palace was indeed much more magnificent than anything they had yet
seen that day, though it would have made but a poor show beside that of the
Babylonian King. They came to it through a great square pillared doorway of
sandstone that stood in a high brick wall. The shut doors were of massive
cedar, with bronze hinges, and were studded with bronze nails. At the side
was a little door and a wicket gate, and through this the priest led the
children. He seemed
<PB ID="p273" N="273">
to know a word that made the sentries make way for him.</P>
<P>Inside was a garden, planted with hundreds of different kinds of trees
and flowering shrubs, a lake full of fish, with blue lotus flowers at the
margin, and ducks swimming about cheerfully, and looking, as Jane said,
quite modern.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The guard&hyphen;chamber, the store&hyphen;houses, the
Queen&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said the priest, pointing them out.</P>
<P>They passed through open courtyards, paved with flat stones, and the
priest whispered to a guard at a great inner gate.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We are fortunate,&rdquo; he said to the children, &ldquo;Pharaoh
is even now in the Court of Honour. Now, don&rsquo;t forget to be overcome
with respect and admiration. It won&rsquo;t do any harm if you fall flat on
your faces. And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t speak until you&rsquo;re
spoken to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There used to be that rule in our country,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;when my father was a little boy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At the outer end of the great hall a crowd of people were arguing with
and even shoving the Guards, who seemed to make it a rule not to let anyone
through unless they were bribed to do it. The children heard several
promises of the utmost richness, and wondered whether they would ever be
kept.</P>
<P>All round the hall were pillars of painted
<PB ID="p274" N="274">
wood. The roof was of cedar, gorgeously inlaid. About half&hyphen;way up
the hall was a wide, shallow step that went right across the hall; then a
little farther on another; and then a steep flight of narrower steps,
leading right up to the throne on which Pharaoh sat. He sat there very
splendid, his red and white double crown on his head, and his sceptre in
his hand. The throne had a canopy of wood and wooden pillars painted in
bright colours. On a low, broad bench that ran all round the hall sat the
friends, relatives, and courtiers of the King, leaning on
richly&hyphen;covered cushions.</P>
<P>The priest led the children up the steps till they all stood before the
throne; and then, suddenly, he fell on his face with hands outstretched.
The others did the same, Anthea falling very carefully because of the
Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Raise them,&rdquo; said the voice of Pharaoh, &ldquo;that they
may speak to me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The officers of the King&rsquo;s household raised them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who are these strangers?&rdquo; Pharaoh asked, and added very
crossly, &ldquo;And what do you mean, Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, by daring to
come into my presence while your innocence is not established?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, great King,&rdquo; said the young priest, &ldquo;you are the
very image of R&amacr;, and the likeness of his son Horus in every respect.
You know the thoughts of the hearts of the gods and of men, and you have
divined
<PB ID="p275" N="275">
that these strangers are the children of the children of the vile and
conquered Kings of the Empire where the sun never sets. They know a magic
not known to the Egyptians. And they come with gifts in their hands as
tribute to Pharaoh, in whose heart is the wisdom of the gods, and on his
lips their truth.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said Pharaoh, &ldquo;but where are
the gifts?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children, bowing as well as they could in their embarrassment at
finding themselves the centre of interest in a circle more grand, more
golden and more highly coloured than they could have imagined possible,
pulled out the padlock,
the <FOREIGN LANG="fre">N&eacute;cessaire</FOREIGN>, and the
tie&hyphen;clip. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not tribute all the same,&rdquo;
Cyril muttered. &ldquo;England doesn&rsquo;t pay tribute!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Pharaoh examined all the things with great interest when the chief of
the household had taken them up to him. &ldquo;Deliver them to the Keeper
of the Treasury,&rdquo; he said to one near him. And to the children he
said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A small tribute, truly, but strange, and not without worth. And
the magic, O Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;These unworthy sons of a conquered nation ...&rdquo; began
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind!&rdquo; Cyril whispered angrily.</P>
<P>&ldquo;... of a vile and conquered nation, can make fire to spring from
dry wood&mdash;in the sight of all.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p276" N="276">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet276"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p277" N="277">
<P>&ldquo;I should jolly well like to see them do it,&rdquo; said Pharaoh,
just as the priest had done.</P>
<P>So Cyril, without more ado, did it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do more magic,&rdquo; said the King, with simple
appreciation.</P>
<P>&ldquo;He cannot do any more magic,&rdquo; said Anthea suddenly, and all
eyes were turned on her, &ldquo;because of the voice of the free people who
are shouting for bread and onions and beer and a long mid&hyphen;day rest.
If the people had what they wanted, he could do more.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A rude&hyphen;spoken girl,&rdquo; said Pharaoh. &ldquo;But give
the dogs what they want,&rdquo; he said, without turning his head.
&ldquo;Let them have their rest and their extra rations. There are plenty
of slaves to work.&rdquo;</P>
<P>A richly&hyphen;dressed official hurried out.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You will be the idol of the people,&rdquo; Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;
whispered joyously; &ldquo;the Temple of Amen will not contain their
offerings.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril struck another match, and all the court was overwhelmed with
delight and wonder. And when Cyril took the candle from his pocket and
lighted it with the match, and then held the burning candle up before the
King the enthusiasm knew no bounds.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, greatest of all, before whom sun and moon and stars bow
down,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; insinuatingly, &ldquo;am I
pardoned? Is my innocence made plain?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;As plain as it ever will be, I daresay,&rdquo; said
<PB ID="p278" N="278">
Pharaoh shortly. &ldquo;Get along with you. You are pardoned. Go in
peace.&rdquo; The priest went with lightning swiftness.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said the King suddenly, &ldquo;is it that moves
in that sack? Show me, oh strangers.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was nothing for it but to show the Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Seize it,&rdquo; said Pharaoh carelessly. &ldquo;A very curious
monkey. It will be a nice little novelty for my wild beast
collection.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And instantly, the entreaties of the children availing as little as the
bites of the Psammead, though both bites and entreaties were fervent, it
was carried away from before their eyes.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>do</EMPH> be careful!&rdquo; cried Anthea. &ldquo;At
least keep it dry! Keep it in its sacred house!&rdquo;</P>
<P>She held up the embroidered bag.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a magic creature,&rdquo; cried Robert;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s simply priceless!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to take it away,&rdquo; cried Jane
incautiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, a barefaced robbery, that&rsquo;s
what it is!&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was an awful silence. Then Pharaoh spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take the sacred house of the beast from them,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and imprison all. To&hyphen;night after supper it may be our
pleasure to see more magic. Guard them well, and do not torture
them&mdash;yet!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sobbed Jane, as they were led
<PB ID="p279" N="279">
away. &ldquo;I knew exactly what it would be! Oh, I wish you
hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shut up, silly,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;You know you
<EMPH>would</EMPH> come to Egypt. It was your own idea entirely. Shut up.
It&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I thought we should play ball with queens,&rdquo; sobbed Jane,
&ldquo;and have no end of larks! And now everything&rsquo;s going to be
perfectly horrid!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The room they were shut up in <EMPH>was</EMPH> a room, and not a
dungeon, as the elder ones had feared. That, as Anthea said, was one
comfort. There were paintings on the wall that at any other time would have
been most interesting. And a sort of low couch, and chairs.</P>
<P>When they were alone Jane breathed a sigh of relief.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now we can get home all right,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And leave the Psammead?&rdquo; said Anthea reproachfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wait a sec. I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; said Cyril. He
pondered for a few moments. Then he began hammering on the heavy cedar
door. It opened, and a guard put in his head.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Stop that row,&rdquo; he said sternly,
&ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Cyril interrupted, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very dull
for you isn&rsquo;t it? Just doing nothing but guard us. Wouldn&rsquo;t you
like to see some magic? We&rsquo;re not too proud to do it for you.
Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; said the guard.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well then, you get us that monkey of
<PB ID="p280" N="280">
ours that was taken away, and we&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;re not making game of me?&rdquo; asked
the soldier. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you only wanted to get the
creature so as to set it on me. I daresay its teeth and claws are
poisonous.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;You see we&rsquo;ve
got nothing with us? You just shut the door, and open it again in five
minutes, and we&rsquo;ll have got a magic&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;a magic flower in a pot for you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you can do that you can do anything,&rdquo; said the soldier,
and he went out and barred the door.</P>
<P>Then, of course, they held up the Amulet. They found the East by holding
it up, and turning slowly till the Amulet began to grow big, walked home
through it, and came back with a geranium in full scarlet flower from the
staircase window of the Fitzroy Street house.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the soldier when he came in. &ldquo;I really
am&mdash;!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can do much more wonderful things than that&mdash;oh, ever so
much,&rdquo; said Anthea persuasively, &ldquo;if we only have our monkey.
And here&rsquo;s twopence for yourself.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The soldier looked at the twopence.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>Robert explained how much simpler it was to pay money for things than to
exchange them as the people were doing in the market.
<PB ID="p281" N="281">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet281"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p282" N="282">
Later on the soldier gave the coins to his captain, who, later still,
showed them to Pharaoh, who of course kept them and was much struck with
the idea. That was really how coins first came to be used in Egypt. You
will not believe this, I daresay, but really, if you believe the rest of
the story, I don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t believe this as
well.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Anthea, struck by a sudden thought, &ldquo;I
suppose it&rsquo;ll be all right about those workmen? The King won&rsquo;t
go back on what he said about them just because he&rsquo;s angry with
us?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;you see, he&rsquo;s
rather afraid of magic. He&rsquo;ll keep to his word right
enough.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then <EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> all right,&rdquo; said Robert; and
Anthea said softly and coaxingly&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, <EMPH>do</EMPH> get us the monkey, and then you&rsquo;ll see
some lovely magic. Do&mdash;there&rsquo;s a nice, kind soldier.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;ve put your precious monkey,
but if I can get another chap to take on my duty here I&rsquo;ll see what I
can do,&rdquo; he said grudgingly, and went out.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;re going
off without even <EMPH>trying</EMPH> for the other half of the
Amulet?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I really think we&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Anthea
tremulously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course the other half of the Amulet&rsquo;s here somewhere or
our half wouldn&rsquo;t have
<PB ID="p283" N="283">
brought us here. I do wish we could find it. It is a pity we don&rsquo;t
know any <EMPH>real</EMPH> magic. Then we could find out. I do wonder where
it is&mdash;exactly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>If they had only known it, something very like the other half of the
Amulet was very near them. It hung round the neck of some one, and that
some one was watching them through a chink, high up in the wall, specially
devised for watching people who were imprisoned. But they did
<EMPH>not</EMPH> know.</P>
<P>There was nearly an hour of anxious waiting. They tried to take an
interest in the picture on the wall, a picture of harpers playing very odd
harps and women dancing at a feast. They examined the painted plaster
floor, and the chairs were of white painted wood with coloured stripes at
intervals.</P>
<P>But the time went slowly, and every one had time to think of how Pharaoh
had said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t torture
them&mdash;<EMPH>yet</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we
must just bunk, and leave the Psammead. I believe it can take care of
itself well enough. They won&rsquo;t kill it or hurt it when they find it
can speak and give wishes. They&rsquo;ll build it a temple, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to go without it,&rdquo; said Anthea,
&ldquo;and Pharaoh said &lsquo;After supper,&rsquo; that won&rsquo;t be
just yet. And the soldier <EMPH>was</EMPH> curious. I&rsquo;m sure
we&rsquo;re all right for the present.&rdquo;</P>
<P>All the same, the sounds of the door
<PB ID="p284" N="284">
being unbarred seemed one of the prettiest sounds possible.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose he hasn&rsquo;t got the Psammead?&rdquo; whispered
Jane.</P>
<P>But that doubt was set at rest by the Psammead itself; for almost before
the door was open it sprang through the chink of it into Anthea&rsquo;s
arms, shivering and hunching up its fur.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s its fancy overcoat,&rdquo; said the soldier, holding
out the bag, into which the Psammead immediately crept.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;what would you like us to do?
Anything you&rsquo;d like us to get for you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Any little trick you like,&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;If you
can get a strange flower blooming in an earthenware vase you can get
anything, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just wish I&rsquo;d got two
men&rsquo;s loads of jewels from the King&rsquo;s treasury. That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ve always wished for.&rdquo;</P>
<P>At the word &ldquo;<EMPH>wish</EMPH>&rdquo; the children knew that the
Psammead would attend to <EMPH>that</EMPH> bit of magic. It did, and the
floor was littered with a spreading heap of gold and precious stones.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Any other little trick?&rdquo; asked Cyril loftily. &ldquo;Shall
we become invisible? Vanish?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, if you like,&rdquo; said the soldier; &ldquo;but not through
the door, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He closed it carefully and set his broad Egyptian back against it.</P>
<PB ID="p285" N="285">
<P>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; cried a voice high up among the tops of the tall
wooden pillars that stood against the wall. There was a sound of some one
moving above.</P>
<P>The soldier was as much surprised as anybody.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s magic, if you like,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>And then Jane held up the Amulet, uttering the word of Power. At the
sound of it and at the sight of the Amulet growing into the great arch the
soldier fell flat on his face among the jewels with a cry of awe and
terror.</P>
<P>The children went through the arch with a quickness born of long
practice. But Jane stayed in the middle of the arch and looked back.</P>
<P>The others, standing on the dining&hyphen;room carpet in Fitzroy Street,
turned and saw her still in the arch. &ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s holding
her,&rdquo; cried Cyril. &ldquo;We must go back.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But they pulled at Jane&rsquo;s hands just to see if she would come,
and, of course, she did come.</P>
<P>Then, as usual, the arch was little again and there they all were.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I do wish you hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jane said crossly.
&ldquo;It <EMPH>was</EMPH> so interesting. The priest had come in and he
was kicking the soldier, and telling him he&rsquo;d done it now, and they
must take the jewels and flee for their lives.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And did they?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p286" N="286">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet286"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p287" N="287">
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You interfered,&rdquo; said Jane
ungratefully. &ldquo;I <EMPH>should</EMPH> have liked to see the last of
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>As a matter of fact, none of them had seen the last of it&mdash;if by
&ldquo;it&rdquo; Jane meant the adventure of the Priest and the
Soldier.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE SORRY&hyphen;PRESENT AND THE EXPELLED LITTLE
BOY</HEAD>
<P>&ldquo;<HI>LOOK</HI> here, said Cyril, sitting on the
dining&hyphen;table and swinging his legs; &ldquo;I really have got
it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Got what?&rdquo; was the not unnatural rejoinder of the
others.</P>
<P>Cyril was making a boat with a penknife and a piece of wood, and the
girls were making warm frocks for their dolls, for the weather was growing
chilly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s really not any good our
going into the Past looking for that Amulet. The Past&rsquo;s as full of
different times as&mdash;as the sea is of sand. We&rsquo;re simply bound to
hit upon the wrong time. We might spend our lives looking for the Amulet
and never see a sight of it. Why, it&rsquo;s the end of September already.
It&rsquo;s like looking for a needle in&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A bottle of hay&mdash;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Robert;
&ldquo;but if we don&rsquo;t go on doing that, what <EMPH>are</EMPH> we to
do?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p289" N="289">
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Cyril in mysterious accents.
&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>bother</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Old Nurse had come in with the tray of knives, forks, and glasses, and
was getting the tablecloth and table&hyphen;napkins out of the chiffonier
drawer.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always meal&hyphen;times just when you come to
anything interesting.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And a nice inter<EMPH>es</EMPH>ting handful
<EMPH>you&rsquo;d</EMPH> be, Master Cyril,&rdquo; said old Nurse, &ldquo;if
I wasn&rsquo;t to bring your meals up to time. Don&rsquo;t you begin
grumbling now, fear you get something to grumble
<EMPH>at</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t grumbling,&rdquo; said Cyril quite untruly;
&ldquo;but it does always happen like that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You deserve to <EMPH>have</EMPH> something happen,&rdquo; said
old Nurse. &ldquo;Slave, slave, slave for you day and night, and never a
word of thanks...&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, you do everything beautifully,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time any of you&rsquo;s troubled to say so,
anyhow,&rdquo; said Nurse shortly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of <EMPH>saying</EMPH>?&rdquo; inquired
Robert. &ldquo;We <EMPH>eat</EMPH> our meals fast enough, and almost always
two helps. <EMPH>That</EMPH> ought to show you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said old Nurse, going round the table and putting the
knives and forks in their places; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a man all over,
Master Robert. There was my poor Green, all the years he lived with me I
never could get
<PB ID="p290" N="290">
more out of him than &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rsquo; when I asked him
if he&rsquo;d fancied his dinner. And yet, when he lay a&hyphen;dying, his
last words to me was, &lsquo;Maria, you was always a good
cook!&rsquo;&rdquo; She ended with a trembling voice.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And so you are,&rdquo; cried Anthea, and she and Jane instantly
hugged her.</P>
<P>When she had gone out of the room Anthea said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know exactly how she feels. Now, look here! Let&rsquo;s do a
penance to show we&rsquo;re sorry we didn&rsquo;t think about telling her
before what nice cooking she does, and what a dear she is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Penances are silly,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not if the penance is something to please some one else. I
didn&rsquo;t mean old peas and hair shirts and sleeping on the stones. I
mean we&rsquo;ll make her a sorry&hyphen;present,&rdquo; explained Anthea.
&ldquo;Look here! I vote Cyril doesn&rsquo;t tell us his idea until
we&rsquo;ve done something for old Nurse. It&rsquo;s worse for us than
him,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;because he knows what it is and we
don&rsquo;t. Do you all agree?&rdquo;</P>
<P>The others would have been ashamed not to agree, so they did. It was not
till quite near the end of dinner&mdash;mutton fritters and blackberry and
apple pie&mdash;that out of the earnest talk of the four came an idea that
pleased everybody and would, they hoped, please Nurse.</P>
<P>Cyril and Robert went out with the taste
<PB ID="p291" N="291">
of apple still in their mouths and the purple of blackberries on their
lips&mdash;and, in the case of Robert, on the wristband as well&mdash;and
bought a big sheet of cardboard at the stationers. Then at the
plumber&rsquo;s shop, that has tubes and pipes and taps and
gas&hyphen;fittings in the window, they bought a pane of glass the same
size as the cardboard. The man cut it with a very interesting tool that had
a bit of diamond at the end, and he gave them, out of his own free
generousness, a large piece of putty and a small piece of glue.</P>
<P>While they were out the girls had floated four photographs of the four
children off their cards in hot water. These were now stuck in a row along
the top of the cardboard. Cyril put the glue to melt in a jampot, and put
the jampot in a saucepan and saucepan on the fire, while Robert painted a
wreath of poppies round the photographs. He painted rather well and very
quickly, and poppies are easy to do if you&rsquo;ve once been shown how.
Then Anthea drew some printed letters and Jane coloured them. The words
were&colon;</P>
<Q><L>&ldquo;With all our loves to shew</L><L REND="indent1">We like the
thigs to eat.&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>And when the painting was dry they all signed their names at the bottom
and put the glass on, and glued brown paper round the edge and over the
back, and put two loops of tape to hang it up by.</P>
<PB ID="p292" N="292">
<P>Of course every one saw when too late that there were not enough letters
in &ldquo;things,&rdquo; so the missing &ldquo;n&rdquo; was put in. It was
impossible, of course, to do the whole thing over again for just one
letter.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Anthea, placing it carefully, face up, under
the sofa. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be hours before the glue&rsquo;s dry. Now,
Squirrel, fire ahead!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Cyril in a great hurry, rubbing at his
gluey hands with his pocket handkerchief. &ldquo;What I mean to say is
this.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a long pause.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Robert at last, &ldquo;<EMPH>what</EMPH> is it
that you mean to say?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Cyril, and again stopped
short.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Like <EMPH>what</EMPH>?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How can I tell you if you will all keep on interrupting?&rdquo;
said Cyril sharply.</P>
<P>So no one said any more, and with wrinkled frowns he arranged his
ideas.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what I really mean is&mdash;we
can remember now what we did when we went to look for the Amulet. And if
we&rsquo;d found it we should remember that too.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Only, you see we
haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But in the future we shall have.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shall we, though?&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;unless we&rsquo;ve been made fools of by the Psammead.
So then, where we want to go to is where we shall remember about where we
did find it.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p293" N="293">
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Robert, but he didn&rsquo;t.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anthea, who did, very
nearly. &ldquo;Say it again, Squirrel, and very slowly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Cyril, very slowly indeed, &ldquo;we go into the
future&mdash;after we&rsquo;ve found the Amulet&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to find it first,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There will be a future,&rdquo; said Cyril, driven to greater
clearness by the blank faces of the other three, &ldquo;there will be a
time <EMPH>after</EMPH> we&rsquo;ve found it. Let&rsquo;s go into
<EMPH>that</EMPH> time&mdash;and then we shall remember <EMPH>how</EMPH> we
found it. And then we can go back and do the finding really.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Robert, and this time he did, and I hope
<EMPH>you</EMPH> do.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Oh, Squirrel, how clever of
you!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But will the Amulet work both ways?&rdquo; inquired Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It ought to,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;if time&rsquo;s only a
thingummy of whatsitsname. Anyway we might try.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put on our best things, then,&rdquo; urged Jane.
&ldquo;You know what people say about progress and the world growing better
and brighter. I expect people will be awfully smart in the
future.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;we should have to wash
anyway, I&rsquo;m all thick with glue.&rdquo;</P>
<P>When every one was clean and dressed, the charm was held up.</P>
<PB ID="p294" N="294">
<P>&ldquo;We want to go into the future and see the Amulet after
we&rsquo;ve found it,&rdquo; said Cyril, and Jane said the word of Power.
They walked through the big arch of the charm straight into the British
Museum. They knew it at once, and there, right in front of them, under a
glass case, was the Amulet&mdash;their own half of it, as well as the other
half they had never been able to find&mdash;and the two were joined by a
pin of red stone that formed a hinge.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, glorious!&rdquo; cried Robert. &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cyril, very gloomily, &ldquo;here it is. But we
can&rsquo;t get it out.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robert, remembering how impossible the Queen of
Babylon had found it to get anything out of the glass cases in the
Museum&mdash;except by Psammead magic, and then she hadn&rsquo;t been able
to take anything away with her; &ldquo;no&mdash;but we remember where we
got it, and we can&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>do</EMPH> we?&rdquo; interrupted Cyril bitterly,
&ldquo;do <EMPH>you</EMPH> remember where we got it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly, now I come
to think of it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Nor did any of the others!</P>
<P>&ldquo;But <EMPH>why</EMPH> can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>I</EMPH> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Cyril&rsquo;s tone
was impatient, &ldquo;some silly old enchanted rule I suppose. I wish
people would teach you magic at school like they do sums&mdash;or instead
of. It would be some use having an Amulet then.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p295" N="295">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet295"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p296" N="296">
<P>&ldquo;I wonder how far we are in the future,&rdquo; said Anthea; the
Museum looks just the same, only lighter and brighter, somehow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and try the Past again,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Perhaps the Museum people could tell us how we got it,&rdquo;
said Anthea with sudden hope. There was no one in the room, but in the next
gallery, where the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a kind,
stout man in a loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ve got a new uniform, how pretty!&rdquo; said
Jane.</P>
<P>When they asked him their question he showed them a label on the case.
It said, &ldquo;From the collection of&mdash;.&rdquo; A name followed, and
it was the name of the learned gentleman who, among themselves, and to his
face when he had been with them at the other side of the Amulet, they had
called Jimmy.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>That&rsquo;s</EMPH> not much good,&rdquo; said Cyril,
&ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re not at school?&rdquo; asked the kind man
in blue. &ldquo;Not expelled for long I hope?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not expelled at all,&rdquo; said Cyril rather
warmly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t do it again, if I were you,&rdquo; said
the man, and they could see he did not believe them. There is no company so
little pleasing as that of people who do not believe you.</P>
<PB ID="p297" N="297">
<P>&ldquo;Thank you for showing us the label,&rdquo; said Cyril. And they
came away.</P>
<P>As they came through the doors of the Museum they blinked at the sudden
glory of sunlight and blue sky. The houses opposite the Museum were gone.
Instead there was a big garden, with trees and flowers and smooth green
lawns, and not a single notice to tell you not to walk on the grass and not
to destroy the trees and shrubs and not to pick the flowers. There were
comfortable seats all about, and arbours covered with roses, and long,
trellised walks, also rose&hyphen;covered. Whispering, splashing fountains
fell into full white marble basins, white statues gleamed among the leaves,
and the pigeons that swept about among the branches or pecked on the
smooth, soft gravel were not black and tumbled like the Museum pigeons are
now, but bright and clean and sleek as birds of new silver. A good many
people were sitting on the seats, and on the grass babies were rolling and
kicking and playing&mdash;with very little on indeed. Men, as well as
women, seemed to be in charge of the babies and were playing with them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a lovely picture,&rdquo; said Anthea, and it was.
For the people&rsquo;s clothes were of bright, soft colours and all
beautifully and very simply made. No one seemed to have any hats or
bonnets, but there were a great many Japanese&hyphen;looking sunshades. And
among the trees were hung lamps of coloured glass.</P>
<PB ID="p298" N="298">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet298"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p299" N="299">
<P>&ldquo;I expect they light those in the evening,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;I <EMPH>do</EMPH> wish we lived in the future!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They walked down the path, and as they went the people on the benches
looked at the four children very curiously, but not rudely or unkindly. The
children, in their turn, looked&mdash;I hope they did not stare&mdash;at
the faces of these people in the beautiful soft clothes. Those faces were
worth looking at. Not that they were all handsome, though even in the
matter of handsomeness they had the advantage of any set of people the
children had ever seen. But it was the expression of their faces that made
them worth looking at. The children could not tell at first what it
was.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Anthea suddenly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
worried; that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And it was. Everybody looked calm, no one seemed to be in a hurry, no
one seemed to be anxious, or fretted, and though some did seem to be sad,
not a single one looked worried.</P>
<P>But though the people looked kind every one looked so interested in the
children that they began to feel a little shy and turned out of the big
main path into a narrow little one that wound among trees and shrubs and
mossy, dripping springs.</P>
<P>It was here, in a deep, shadowed cleft between tall cypresses, that they
found the expelled little boy. He was lying face downward on the mossy
turf, and the peculiar
<PB ID="p300" N="300">
shaking of his shoulders was a thing they had seen, more than once, in each
other. So Anthea kneeled down by him and said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expelled from school,&rdquo; said the boy between his
sobs.</P>
<P>This was serious. People are not expelled for light offences.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you mind telling us what you&rsquo;d done?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&mdash;I tore up a sheet of paper and threw it about in the
playground,&rdquo; said the child, in the tone of one confessing an
unutterable baseness. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t talk to me any more now you
know that,&rdquo; he added without looking up.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about enough,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m expelled for the whole day!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; said Anthea, gently. The
boy lifted his face, rolled over, and sat up.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, whoever on earth are you?&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re strangers from a far country,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;In our country it&rsquo;s not a crime to leave a bit of paper
about.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;If grown&hyphen;ups do
it they&rsquo;re fined. When we do it we&rsquo;re expelled for the whole
day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;that just means a
day&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You <EMPH>must</EMPH> come from a long way off,&rdquo; said the
little boy. &ldquo;A holiday&rsquo;s when you all
<PB ID="p301" N="301">
have play and treats and jolliness, all of you together. On your expelled
days no one&rsquo;ll speak to you. Every one sees you&rsquo;re an
Expelleder or you&rsquo;d be in school.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Suppose you were ill?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nobody is&mdash;hardly. If they are, of course they wear the
badge, and every one is kind to you. I know a boy that stole his
sister&rsquo;s illness badge and wore it when he was expelled for a day.
<EMPH>He</EMPH> got expelled for a week for that. It must be awful not to
go to school for a week.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you <EMPH>like</EMPH> school, then?&rdquo; asked Robert
incredulously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course I do. It&rsquo;s the loveliest place there is. I chose
railways for my special subject this year, there are such splendid models
and things, and now I shall be all behind because of that torn&hyphen;up
paper.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You choose your own subject?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Where <EMPH>did</EMPH> you come from? Don&rsquo;t
you know <EMPH>anything</EMPH>?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane definitely; &ldquo;so you&rsquo;d better
tell us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, on Midsummer Day school breaks up and everything&rsquo;s
decorated with flowers, and you choose your special subject for next year.
Of course you have to stick to it for a year at least. Then there are all
your other subjects, of course, reading, and painting, and the rules of
Citizenship.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<PB ID="p302" N="302">
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the child, jumping up, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
nearly four. The expelledness only lasts till then. Come home with me.
Mother will tell you all about everything.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Will your mother like you taking home strange children?&rdquo;
asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the child, settling his
leather belt over his honey&hyphen;coloured smock and stepping out with
hard little bare feet. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they went.</P>
<P>The streets were wide and hard and very clean. There were no horses, but
a sort of motor carriage that made no noise. The Thames flowed between
green banks, and there were trees at the edge, and people sat under them,
fishing, for the stream was clear as crystal. Everywhere there were green
trees and there was no smoke. The houses were set in what seemed like one
green garden.</P>
<P>The little boy brought them to a house, and at the window was a good,
bright mother&hyphen;face. The little boy rushed in, and through the window
they could see him hugging his mother, then his eager lips moving and his
quick hands pointing.</P>
<P>A lady in soft green clothes came out, spoke kindly to them, and took
them into the oddest house they had ever seen. It was very bare, there were
no ornaments, and yet every single thing was beautiful, from the dresser
with its rows of bright china, to the thick squares of
<PB ID="p303" N="303">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet303"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p304" N="304">
Eastern&hyphen;looking carpet on the floors. I can&rsquo;t describe that
house; I haven&rsquo;t the time. And I haven&rsquo;t heart either, when I
think how different it was from our houses. The lady took them all over it.
The oddest thing of all was the big room in the middle. It had padded walls
and a soft, thick carpet, and all the chairs and tables were padded. There
wasn&rsquo;t a single thing in it that anyone could hurt itself with.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What ever&rsquo;s this for?&mdash;lunatics?&rdquo; asked
Cyril.</P>
<P>The lady looked very shocked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s for the children, of course,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that in your country there are no
children&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There are nurseries,&rdquo; said Anthea doubtfully, &ldquo;but
the furniture&rsquo;s all cornery and hard, like other rooms.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How shocking!&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;you must be
<EMPH>very</EMPH> much behind the times in your country! Why, the children
are more than half of the people; it&rsquo;s not much to have one room
where they can have a good time and not hurt themselves.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no fireplace,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hot&hyphen;air pipes, of course,&rdquo; said the lady.
&ldquo;Why, how could you have a fire in a nursery? A child might get
burned.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In our country,&rdquo; said Robert suddenly, &ldquo;more than
three thousand children are burned to death every year. Father told
me,&rdquo; he added, as if apologizing for this
<PB ID="p305" N="305">
piece of information, &ldquo;once when I&rsquo;d been playing with
fire.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The lady turned quite pale.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a frightful place you must live in!&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the furniture padded for?&rdquo; Anthea asked,
hastily turning the subject.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, you couldn&rsquo;t have little tots of two or three running
about in rooms where the things were hard and sharp! They might hurt
themselves.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert fingered the scar on his forehead where he had hit it against the
nursery fender when he was little.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But does every one have rooms like this, poor people and
all?&rdquo; asked Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a room like this wherever there&rsquo;s a child, of
course,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;How refreshingly ignorant you
are!&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t mean ignorant, my dear. Of course,
you&rsquo;re awfully well up in Ancient History. But I see you
haven&rsquo;t done your Duties of Citizenship Course yet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But beggars, and people like that?&rdquo; persisted Anthea
&ldquo;and tramps and people who haven&rsquo;t any homes?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;People who haven&rsquo;t any homes?&rdquo; repeated the lady.
&ldquo;I really <EMPH>don&rsquo;t</EMPH> understand what you&rsquo;re
talking about.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all different in our country,&rdquo; said Cyril
carefully; &ldquo;and I have read it used to be different in London.
Usedn&rsquo;t people to have no homes and beg because
<PB ID="p306" N="306">
they were hungry? And wasn&rsquo;t London very black and dirty once upon a
time? And the Thames all muddy and filthy? And narrow streets,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You must have been reading very old&hyphen;fashioned
books,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Why, all that was in the dark ages! My
husband can tell you more about it than I can. He took Ancient History as
one of his special subjects.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any working people,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re all working people,&rdquo; said the lady;
&ldquo;at least my husband&rsquo;s a carpenter.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Anthea; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re a
lady!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;that quaint old word! Well, my
husband <EMPH>will</EMPH> enjoy a talk with you. In the dark ages every one
was allowed to have a smoky chimney, and those nasty horses all over the
streets, and all sorts of rubbish thrown into the Thames. And, of course,
the sufferings of the people will hardly bear thinking of. It&rsquo;s very
learned of you to know it all. Did <EMPH>you</EMPH> make Ancient History
your special subject?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Cyril, rather uneasily. &ldquo;What is
the Duties of Citizenship Course about?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <EMPH>really</EMPH> know? Aren&rsquo;t you
pretending&mdash;just for fun? Really not? Well, that course teaches you
how to be a good citizen, what you must do and what you mayn&rsquo;t do, so
as to do your full share of the
<PB ID="p307" N="307">
work of making your town a beautiful and happy place for people to live in.
There&rsquo;s a quite simple little thing they teach the tiny children. How
does it go ...?</P>
<Q><L>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must not steal and I must learn,</L><L>Nothing is
mine that I do not earn.</L><L>I must try in work and play</L><L>To make
things beautiful every day.</L><L>I must be kind to every one,</L><L>And
never let cruel things be done.</L><L>I must be brave, and I must
try</L><L>When I am hurt never to cry,</L><L>And always laugh as much as I
can,</L><L>And be glad that I&rsquo;m going to be a man</L><L>To work for
my living and help the rest</L><L>And never do less than my very
best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very easy,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH>
could remember that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only the very beginning, of course,&rdquo; said the
lady; &ldquo;there are heaps more rhymes. There&rsquo;s the one
beginning&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&ldquo;I must not litter the beautiful street</L><L>With bits of
paper or things to eat;</L><L>I must not pick the public
flowers,</L><L>They are not <EMPH>mine</EMPH>, but they are
<EMPH>ours</EMPH>.&rdquo;</L></Q>
<P>&ldquo;And &lsquo;things to eat&rsquo; reminds me&mdash;are you hungry?
Wells, run and get a tray of nice things.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why do you call him &lsquo;Wells&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Robert, as
the boy ran off.</P>
<PB ID="p308" N="308">
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after the great reformer&mdash;surely you&rsquo;ve
heard of <EMPH>him</EMPH>? He lived in the dark ages, and he saw that what
you ought to do is to find out what you want and then try to get it. Up to
then people had always tried to tinker up what they&rsquo;d got.
We&rsquo;ve got a great many of the things he thought of. Then
&lsquo;Wells&rsquo; means springs of clear water. It&rsquo;s a nice name,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Here Wells returned with strawberries and cakes and lemonade on a tray,
and everybody ate and enjoyed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now, Wells,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;run off or you&rsquo;ll
be late and not meet your Daddy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Wells kissed her, waved to the others, and went.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Anthea suddenly, &ldquo;would you like to
come to <EMPH>our</EMPH> country, and see what it&rsquo;s like? It
wouldn&rsquo;t take you a minute.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The lady laughed. But Jane held up the charm and said the word.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a splendid conjuring trick!&rdquo; cried the lady, enchanted
with the beautiful, growing arch.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Go through,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>The lady went, laughing. But she did not laugh when she found herself,
suddenly, in the dining&hyphen;room at Fitzroy Street.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, what a <EMPH>horrible</EMPH> trick!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;What a hateful, dark, ugly place!&rdquo;</P>
<P>She ran to the window and looked out. The sky was grey, the street was
foggy, a dismal organ&hyphen;grinder was standing opposite the door,
<PB ID="p309" N="309">
a beggar and a man who sold matches were quarrelling at the edge of the
pavement on whose greasy black surface people hurried along, hastening to
get to the shelter of their houses.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, look at their faces, their horrible faces!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with them all?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re poor people, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s <EMPH>not</EMPH> all! They&rsquo;re ill,
they&rsquo;re unhappy, they&rsquo;re wicked! Oh, do stop it, there&rsquo;s
dear children. It&rsquo;s very, very clever. Some sort of
magic&hyphen;lantern trick, I suppose, like I&rsquo;ve read of. But
<EMPH>do</EMPH> stop it. Oh! their poor, tired, miserable, wicked
faces!&rdquo;</P>
<P>The tears were in her eyes. Anthea signed to Jane. The arch grew, they
spoke the words, and pushed the lady through it into her own time and
place, where London is clean and beautiful, and the Thames runs clear and
bright, and the green trees grow, and no one is afraid, or anxious, or in a
hurry.</P>
<P>There was a silence. Then&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we went,&rdquo; said Anthea, with a deep
breath.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never throw paper about again as long as I
live,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Mother always told us not to,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I would like to take up the Duties of Citizenship for a special
subject,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I wonder if Father could put me through
it. I shall ask him when he comes home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;d found the Amulet, Father could be
<PB ID="p310" N="310">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet310"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p311" N="311">
home <EMPH>now</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and Mother and The
Lamb.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the future <EMPH>again</EMPH>,&rdquo;
suggested Jane brightly. &ldquo;Perhaps we could remember if it
wasn&rsquo;t such an awful way off.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they did. This time they said, &ldquo;The future, where the Amulet
is, not so far away.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And they went through the familiar arch into a large, light room with
three windows. Facing them was the familiar mummy&hyphen;case. And at a
table by the window sat the learned gentleman. They knew him at once,
though his hair was white. His was one of the faces that do not change with
age. In his hand was the Amulet&mdash;complete and perfect.</P>
<P>He rubbed his other hand across his forehead in the way they were so
used to.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dreams, dreams!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;old age is full of
them!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in dreams with us before now,&rdquo; said
Robert, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I do, indeed,&rdquo; said he. The room had many more books than
the Fitzroy Street room, and far more curious and wonderful Assyrian and
Egyptian objects. &ldquo;the most wonderful dreams I ever had, had you in
them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; asked Cyril, &ldquo;did you get that thing in your
hand?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t just a dream,&rdquo; he answered, smiling,
you&rsquo;d remember that you gave it to me.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p312" N="312">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet312"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p313" N="313">
<P>&ldquo;But where did we get it?&rdquo; Cyril asked eagerly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, you never would tell me that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
always had your little mysteries. You dear children! What a difference you
made to that old Bloomsbury house! I wish I could dream you oftener. Now
you&rsquo;re grown up you&rsquo;re not like you used to be.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Grown up?&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman pointed to a frame with four photographs in
it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P>The children saw four grown&hyphen;up people&rsquo;s portraits&mdash;two
ladies, two gentlemen&mdash;and looked on them with loathing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shall we grow up like <EMPH>that</EMPH>?&rdquo; whispered Jane.
&ldquo;How perfectly horrid!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re ever like that, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know
it&rsquo;s horrid, I expect,&rdquo; Anthea with some insight whispered
back. &ldquo;You see, you get used to yourself while you&rsquo;re changing.
It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s being so sudden makes it seem so frightful
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The learned gentleman was looking at them with wistful kindness.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me undream you just yet,&rdquo; he said. There was a
pause.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you remember <EMPH>when</EMPH> we gave you that Amulet?&rdquo;
Cyril asked suddenly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You know, or you would if you weren&rsquo;t a dream, that it was
on the 3rd December, 1905. I shall never forget <EMPH>that</EMPH>
day.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p314" N="314">
<P>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Cyril, earnestly; &ldquo;oh, thank you
very much.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a new room,&rdquo; said Anthea, looking out of
the window, &ldquo;and what a lovely garden!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old now to care even
about being near the Museum. This is a beautiful place. Do you know&mdash;I
can hardly believe you&rsquo;re just a dream, you do look so exactly real.
Do you know ...&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;I can say it to
<EMPH>you</EMPH>, though, of course, if I said it to anyone that
wasn&rsquo;t a dream they&rsquo;d call me mad; there was something about
that Amulet you gave me&mdash;something very mysterious.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There was that,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t mean your pretty little childish mysteries
about where you got it. But about the thing itself. First, the wonderful
dreams I used to have, after you&rsquo;d shown me the first half of it!
Why, my book on Atlantis, that I did, was the beginning of my fame and my
fortune, too. And I got it all out of a dream! And then, &lsquo;Britain at
the Time of the Roman Invasion&rsquo;&mdash;that was only a pamphlet, but
it explained a lot of things people hadn&rsquo;t understood.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;it would.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That was the beginning. But after you&rsquo;d given me the whole
of the Amulet&mdash;ah, it was generous of you!&mdash;then, somehow, I
didn&rsquo;t need to theorize, I seemed to <EMPH>know</EMPH> about the old
Egyptian civilisation. And they
<PB ID="p315" N="315">
can&rsquo;t upset my theories&rdquo;&mdash;he rubbed his thin hands and
laughed triumphantly&mdash;&ldquo;they can&rsquo;t, though they&rsquo;ve
tried. Theories, they call them, but they&rsquo;re more like&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;more like memories. I <EMPH>know</EMPH> I&rsquo;m
right about the secret rites of the Temple of Amen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re rich,&rdquo; said Anthea.
&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t, you know, at Fitzroy Street.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Indeed I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I am now. This
beautiful house and this lovely garden&mdash;I dig in it sometimes; you
remember, you used to tell me to take more exercise? Well, I feel I owe it
all to you&mdash;and the Amulet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Anthea, and kissed him. He
started.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>That</EMPH> didn&rsquo;t feel like a dream,&rdquo; he said,
and his voice trembled.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly a dream,&rdquo; said Anthea softly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all part of the Amulet&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sort of extra
special, real dream, dear Jimmy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when you call me that, I know
I&rsquo;m dreaming. My little sister&mdash;I dream of her sometimes. But
it&rsquo;s not real like this. Do you remember the day I dreamed you
brought me the Babylonish ring?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We remember it all,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Did you leave
Fitzroy Street because you were too rich for it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he said reproachfully. &ldquo;You know I should
never have done such a thing as that. Of course, I left when your old Nurse
died and&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p316" N="316">
<P>&ldquo;Old Nurse <EMPH>dead</EMPH>?&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Oh,
<EMPH>no</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s the common lot. It&rsquo;s a long time ago
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane held up the Amulet in a hand that twittered.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;oh, come home! She may be dead
before we get there, and then we can&rsquo;t give it to her. Oh,
come!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t let the dream end now!&rdquo; pleaded the learned
gentleman.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It must,&rdquo; said Anthea firmly, and kissed him again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;When it comes to people dying,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;good&hyphen;bye! I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re rich and famous and
happy.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Do</EMPH> come!&rdquo; cried Jane, stamping in her agony of
impatience.</P>
<P>And they went. Old Nurse brought in tea almost as soon as they were back
in Fitzroy Street. As she came in with the tray, the girls rushed at her
and nearly upset her and it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die!&rdquo; cried Jane, &ldquo;oh,
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Anthea cried, &ldquo;Dear, ducky, darling old
Nurse, don&rsquo;t die!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Lord, love you!&rdquo; said Nurse, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not agoing to
die yet a while, please Heaven! Whatever on earth&rsquo;s the matter with
the chicks?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nothing. Only don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</P>
<P>She put the tray down and hugged the girls in turn. The boys thumped her
on the back with heartfelt affection.</P>
<PB ID="p317" N="317">
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as well as ever I was in my life,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What nonsense about dying! You&rsquo;ve been a setting too long in
the dusk, that&rsquo;s what it is. Regular blind man&rsquo;s holiday. Leave
go of me, while I light the gas.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The yellow light illuminated four pale faces.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We do love you so,&rdquo; Anthea went on, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve
made you a picture to show you how we love you. Get it out,
Squirrel.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The glazed testimonial was dragged out from under the sofa and
displayed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The glue&rsquo;s not dry yet,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;look
out!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a beauty!&rdquo; cried old Nurse. &ldquo;Well, I never! And
your pictures and the beautiful writing and all. Well, I always did say
your hearts was in the right place, if a bit careless at times. Well! I
never did! I don&rsquo;t know as I was ever pleased better in my
life.&rdquo;</P>
<P>She hugged them all, one after the other. And the boys did not mind it,
somehow, that day.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How is it we can remember all about the future,
<EMPH>now</EMPH>?&rdquo; Anthea woke the Psammead with laborious gentleness
to put the question. &ldquo;How is it we can remember what we saw in the
future, and yet, when we <EMPH>were</EMPH> in the future, we could not
remember the bit of the future that was past then, the time of finding the
Amulet?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, what a silly question!&rdquo; said the
<PB ID="p318" N="318">
Psammead, &ldquo;of course you cannot remember what hasn&rsquo;t happened
yet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But the <EMPH>future</EMPH> hasn&rsquo;t happened yet,&rdquo;
Anthea persisted, &ldquo;and we remember that all right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s happened, my good child,&rdquo;
said the Psammead, rather crossly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s prophetic vision.
And you remember dreams, don&rsquo;t you? So why not visions? You never do
seem to understand the simplest thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It went to sand again at once.</P>
<P>Anthea crept down in her nightgown to give one last kiss to old Nurse,
and one last look at the beautiful testimonial hanging, by its tapes, its
glue now firmly set, in glazed glory on the wall of the kitchen.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good&hyphen;night, bless your loving heart,&rdquo; said old
Nurse, &ldquo;if only you don&rsquo;t catch your deathercold!&rdquo;</P>

<P>&ldquo;<HI>BLUE</HI> and red,&rdquo; said Jane softly, &ldquo;make
purple.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Not always they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;it has to
be crimson lake and Prussian blue. If you mix Vermilion and Indigo you get
the most loathsome slate colour.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sepia&rsquo;s the nastiest colour in the box, I think,&rdquo;
said Jane, sucking her brush.</P>
<P>They were all painting. Nurse in the flush of grateful emotion, excited
by Robert&rsquo;s border of poppies, had presented each of the four with a
shilling paint&hyphen;box, and had supplemented the gift with a pile of old
copies of the <BIBL>Illustrated London News</BIBL>.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Sepia,&rdquo; said Cyril instructively, &ldquo;is made out of
beastly cuttle&hyphen;fish.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Purple&rsquo;s made out of a fish, as well as out of red and
blue,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Tyrian purple was, I know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Out of lobsters?&rdquo; said Jane dreamily. &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
red when they&rsquo;re boiled, and blue
<PB ID="p320" N="320">
when they aren&rsquo;t. If you mixed live and dead lobsters you&rsquo;d get
Tyrian purple.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>I</EMPH> shouldn&rsquo;t like to mix anything with a live
lobster,&rdquo; said Anthea, shuddering.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, there aren&rsquo;t any other red and blue fish,&rdquo; said
Jane; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have to.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not have the purple,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Tyrian purple wasn&rsquo;t that colour when it came out of
the fish, nor yet afterwards, it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Robert;
&ldquo;it was scarlet really, and Roman Emperors wore it. And it
wasn&rsquo;t any nice colour while the fish had it. It was a
yellowish&hyphen;white liquid of a creamy consistency.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I read it,&rdquo; said Robert, with the meek pride of superior
knowledge.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In print,&rdquo; said Robert, still more proudly meek.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You think everything&rsquo;s true if it&rsquo;s printed,&rdquo;
said Cyril, naturally annoyed, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t. Father said so.
Quite a lot of lies get printed, especially in newspapers.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see, as it happens,&rdquo; said Robert, in what was really a
rather annoying tone, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t a newspaper, it was in a
book.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How sweet Chinese white is!&rdquo; said Jane, dreamily sucking
her brush again.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Cyril to Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Have a suck yourself,&rdquo; suggested Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean about the Chinese white. I
<PB ID="p321" N="321">
mean about the cream fish turning purple and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Anthea, jumping up very quickly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of painting. Let&rsquo;s go somewhere by Amulet. I
say let&rsquo;s let <EMPH>it</EMPH> choose.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril and Robert agreed that this was an idea. Jane consented to stop
painting because, as she said, Chinese white, though certainly sweet, gives
you a queer feeling in the back of the throat if you paint with it too
long.</P>
<P>The Amulet was held up.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Take us somewhere,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;anywhere you like in
the Past&mdash;but somewhere where you are.&rdquo; Then she said the
word.</P>
<P>Next moment every one felt a queer rocking and swaying&mdash;something
like what you feel when you go out in a fishing boat. And that was not
wonderful, when you come to think of it, for it was in a boat that they
found themselves. A queer boat, with high bulwarks pierced with holes for
oars to go through. There was a high seat for the steersman, and the prow
was shaped like the head of some great animal with big, staring eyes. The
boat rode at anchor in a bay, and the bay was very smooth. The crew were
dark, wiry fellows with black beards and hair. They had no clothes except a
tunic from waist to knee, and round caps with knobs on the top. They were
very busy, and what they were doing was
<PB ID="p322" N="322">
so interesting to the children that at first they did not even wonder where
the Amulet had brought them.</P>
<P>And the crew seemed too busy to notice the children. They were fastening
rush baskets to a long rope with a great piece of cork at the end, and in
each basket they put mussels or little frogs. Then they cast out the rope,
the baskets sank, but the cork floated. And all about on the blue water
were other boats and all the crews of all the boats were busy with ropes
and baskets and frogs and mussels.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Whatever are you doing?&rdquo; Jane suddenly asked a man who had
rather more clothes than the others, and seemed to be a sort of captain or
overseer. He started and stared at her, but he had seen too many strange
lands to be very much surprised at these queerly&hyphen;dressed
stowaways.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Setting lines for the dye shell&hyphen;fish,&rdquo; he said
shortly. &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;A sort of magic,&rdquo; said Robert carelessly. The Captain
fingered an Amulet that hung round his neck.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tyre, of course,&rdquo; said the man. Then he drew back and spoke
in a low voice to one of the sailors.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now we shall know about your precious cream&hyphen;jug
fish,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But we never <EMPH>said</EMPH> come to Tyre,&rdquo; said
Jane.</P>
<PB ID="p323" N="323">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet323"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p324" N="324">
<P>&ldquo;The Amulet heard us talking, I expect. I think it&rsquo;s
<EMPH>most</EMPH> obliging of it,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And the Amulet&rsquo;s here too,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;We
ought to be able to find it in a little ship like this. I wonder which of
them&rsquo;s got it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;look, look!&rdquo; cried Anthea suddenly. On the bare
breast of one of the sailors gleamed something red. It was the exact
counterpart of their precious half&hyphen;Amulet.</P>
<P>A silence, full of emotion, was broken by Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh do
let&rsquo;s take it and go home!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Easy to say &lsquo;take it&,rsquo;&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;he
looks very strong.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He did&mdash;yet not so strong as the other sailors.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; said Anthea musingly, &ldquo;I do believe
I&rsquo;ve seen that man somewhere before.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather like our learned gentleman,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell you who he&rsquo;s much more
like&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>At that moment that sailor looked up. His eyes met
Robert&rsquo;s&mdash;and Robert and the others had no longer any doubt as
to where they had seen him before. It was Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, the
priest who had led them to the palace of Pharaoh&mdash;and whom Jane had
looked back at through the arch, when he was counselling Pharaoh&rsquo;s
guard to take the jewels and fly for his life.</P>
<P>Nobody was quite pleased, and nobody quite knew why.</P>
<PB ID="p325" N="325">
<P>Jane voiced the feelings of all when she said, fingering
<EMPH>their</EMPH> Amulet through the folds of her frock, &ldquo;We can go
back in a minute if anything nasty happens.&rdquo;</P>
<P>For the moment nothing worse happened than an offer of food&mdash;figs
and cucumbers it was, and very pleasant.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;that you are from a far
country. Since you have honoured my boat by appearing on it, you must stay
here till morning. Then I will lead you to one of our great ones. He loves
strangers from far lands.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; Jane whispered, &ldquo;all the frogs
are drowning <EMPH>now</EMPH>. I think the people here are
cruel.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But the boys wanted to stay and see the lines taken up in the
morning.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like eel&hyphen;pots and
lobster&hyphen;pots,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;the baskets only open from
outside&mdash;I vote we stay.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they stayed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tyre over there,&rdquo; said the Captain, who was
evidently trying to be civil. He pointed to a great island rock, that rose
steeply from the sea, crowned with huge walls and towers. There was another
city on the mainland.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of Tyre, too,&rdquo; said the Captain;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s where the great merchants have their
pleasure&hyphen;houses and gardens and farms.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; Cyril cried suddenly; &ldquo;what a lovely
little ship!&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p326" N="326">
<P>A ship in full sail was passing swiftly through the fishing fleet. The
Captain&rsquo;s face changed. He frowned, and his eyes blazed with
fury.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Insolent young barbarian!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you call the
ships of Tyre <EMPH>little</EMPH>? None greater sail the seas. That ship
has been on a three years&rsquo; voyage. She is known in all the great
trading ports from here to the Tin Islands. She comes back rich and
glorious. Her very anchor is of silver.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Anthea hastily.
&ldquo;In our country we say &lsquo;little&rsquo; for a pet name. Your wife
might call you her dear little husband, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should like to catch her at it,&rdquo; growled the Captain, but
he stopped scowling.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rich trade,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;For cloth
<EMPH>once</EMPH> dipped, second&hyphen;best glass, and the rough images
our young artists carve for practice, the barbarian King in Tessos lets us
work the silver mines. We get so much silver there that we leave them our
iron anchors and come back with silver ones.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Do go on. What&rsquo;s
cloth once dipped?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You <EMPH>must</EMPH> be barbarians from the outer
darkness,&rdquo; said the Captain scornfully. &ldquo;All wealthy nations
know that our finest stuffs are twice dyed&mdash;dibaptha. They&rsquo;re
only for the robes of kings and priests and princes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What do the rich merchants wear,&rdquo; asked Jane, with
interest, &ldquo;in the pleasure&hyphen;houses?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p327" N="327">
<P>&ldquo;They wear the dibaptha. <EMPH>Our</EMPH> merchants
<EMPH>are</EMPH> princes,&rdquo; scowled the skipper.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be cross, we do so like hearing about things. We
want to know <EMPH>all</EMPH> about the dyeing,&rdquo; said Anthea
cordially.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, you do, do you?&rdquo; growled the man. &ldquo;So
that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re here for? Well, you won&rsquo;t get the
secrets of the dye trade out of <EMPH>me</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He went away, and every one felt snubbed and uncomfortable. And all the
time the long, narrow eyes of the Egyptian were watching, watching. They
felt as though he was watching them through the darkness, when they lay
down to sleep on a pile of cloaks.</P>
<P>Next morning the baskets were drawn up full of what looked like whelk
shells.</P>
<P>The children were rather in the way, but they made themselves as small
as they could. While the skipper was at the other end of the boat they did
ask one question of a sailor, whose face was a little less unkind than the
others.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;this is the dye&hyphen;fish.
It&rsquo;s a sort of murex&mdash;and there&rsquo;s another kind that they
catch at Sidon&mdash;and then, of course, there&rsquo;s the kind
that&rsquo;s used for the dibaptha. But that&rsquo;s quite different.
It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; shouted the skipper. And the man held
it.</P>
<P>The laden boat was rowed slowly round the end of the island, and was
made fast in one
<PB ID="p328" N="328">
of the two great harbours that lay inside a long breakwater. The harbour
was full of all sorts of ships, so that Cyril and Robert enjoyed themselves
much more than their sisters. The breakwater and the quays were heaped with
bales and baskets, and crowded with slaves and sailors. Farther along some
men were practising diving.</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jolly good,&rdquo; said Robert, as a naked brown
body cleft the water.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said the skipper. &ldquo;The
pearl&hyphen;divers of Persia are not more skilful. Why, we&rsquo;ve got a
fresh&hyphen;water spring that comes out at the bottom of the sea. Our
divers dive down and bring up the fresh water in skin bottles! Can your
barbarian divers do as much?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Robert, and put away a wild desire to
explain to the Captain the English system of waterworks, pipes, taps, and
the intricacies of the plumbers&rsquo; trade.</P>
<P>As they neared the quay the skipper made a hasty toilet. He did his
hair, combed his beard, put on a garment like a jersey with short sleeves,
an embroidered belt, a necklace of beads, and a big signet ring.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fit to be seen. Come
along?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; said Jane cautiously.</P>
<P>&ldquo;To Pheles, the great sea&hyphen;captain, said the skipper,
&ldquo;the man I told you of, who loves barbarians.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p329" N="329">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet329"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p330" N="330">
<P>Then Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; came forward, and, for the first time,
spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I have known these children in another land,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You know my powers of magic. It was my magic that brought these
barbarians to your boat. And you know how they will profit you. I read your
thoughts. Let me come with you and see the end of them, and then I will
work the spell I promised you in return for the little experience you have
so kindly given me on your boat.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The skipper looked at the Egyptian with some disfavour.</P>
<P>&ldquo;So it was <EMPH>your</EMPH> doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I might
have guessed it. Well, come on.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So he came, and the girls wished he hadn&rsquo;t. But Robert
whispered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nonsense&mdash;as long as he&rsquo;s with us we&rsquo;ve got some
chance of the Amulet. We can always fly if anything goes wrong.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The morning was so fresh and bright; their breakfast had been so good
and so unusual; they had actually seen the Amulet round the
Egyptian&rsquo;s neck. One or two, or all these things, suddenly raised the
children&rsquo;s spirits. They went off quite cheerfully through the city
gate&mdash;it was not arched, but roofed over with a great flat
stone&mdash;and so through the street, which smelt horribly of fish and
garlic and a thousand other things even less agreeable. But far worse than
the street scents was the scent of the factory, where the
<PB ID="p331" N="331">
skipper called in to sell his night&rsquo;s catch. I wish I could tell you
all about that factory, but I haven&rsquo;t time, and perhaps after all you
aren&rsquo;t interested in dyeing works. I will only mention that Robert
was triumphantly proved to be right. The dye <EMPH>was</EMPH> a
yellowish&hyphen;white liquid of a creamy consistency, and it smelt more
strongly of garlic than garlic itself does.</P>
<P>While the skipper was bargaining with the master of the dye works the
Egyptian came close to the children, and said, suddenly and
softly&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Trust me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we could,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You feel,&rdquo; said the Egyptian, &ldquo;that I want your
Amulet. That makes you distrust me.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cyril bluntly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you also, you want my Amulet, and I am trusting
you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We have the two halves of the Amulet,&rdquo; said the Priest,
&ldquo;but not yet the pin that joined them. Our only chance of getting
that is to remain together. Once part these two halves and they may never
be found in the same time and place. Be wise. Our interests are the
same.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Before anyone could say more the skipper came back, and with him the
dye&hyphen;master. His hair and beard were curled like the men&rsquo;s in
Babylon, and he was dressed like the skipper, but with added grandeur of
gold
<PB ID="p332" N="332">
and embroidery. He had necklaces of beads and silver, and a glass amulet
with a man&rsquo;s face, very like his own, set between two bull&rsquo;s
heads, as well as gold and silver bracelets and armlets. He looked keenly
at the children. Then he said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;My brother Pheles has just come back from Tarshish. He&rsquo;s at
his garden house&mdash;unless he&rsquo;s hunting wild boar in the marshes.
He gets frightfully bored on shore.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a true&hyphen;born
Ph&oelig;nician. &lsquo;Tyre, Tyre for ever! Oh, Tyre rules the
waves!&rsquo; as the old song says. I&rsquo;ll go at once, and show him my
young barbarians.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should,&rdquo; said the dye&hyphen;master. &ldquo;They are very
rum, aren&rsquo;t they? What frightful clothes, and what a lot of them!
Observe the covering of their feet. Hideous indeed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Robert could not help thinking how easy, and at the same time pleasant,
it would be to catch hold of the dye&hyphen;master&rsquo;s feet and tip him
backward into the great sunken vat just near him. But if he had, flight
would have had to be the next move, so he restrained his impulse.</P>
<P>There was something about this Tyrian adventure that was different from
all the others. It was, somehow, calmer. And there was the undoubted fact
that the charm was there on the neck of the Egyptian.</P>
<P>So they enjoyed everything to the full, the row from the Island City to
the shore, the
<PB ID="p333" N="333">
ride on the donkeys that the skipper hired at the gate of the mainland
city, and the pleasant country&mdash;palms and figs and cedars all about.
It was like a garden&mdash;clematis, honeysuckle, and jasmine clung about
the olive and mulberry trees, and there were tulips and gladiolus, and
clumps of mandrake, which has bell&hyphen;flowers that look as though they
were cut out of dark blue jewels. In the distance were the mountains of
Lebanon.</P>
<P>The house they came to at last was rather like a bungalow&mdash;long and
low, with pillars all along the front. Cedars and sycamores grew near it
and sheltered it pleasantly.</P>
<P>Every one dismounted, and the donkeys were led away.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why is this like Rosherville?&rdquo; whispered Robert, and
instantly supplied the answer.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s the place to spend a happy day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jolly decent of the skipper to have brought us to such
a ripping place,&rdquo; said Cyril.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;this feels more real than
anything else we&rsquo;ve seen? It&rsquo;s like a holiday in the country at
home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children were left alone in a large hall. The floor was mosaic, done
with wonderful pictures of ships and sea&hyphen;beasts and fishes. Through
an open doorway they could see a pleasant courtyard with flowers.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I should like to spend a week here,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;and
donkey ride every day.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Every one was feeling very jolly. Even the
<PB ID="p334" N="334">
Egyptian looked pleasanter than usual. And then, quite suddenly, the
skipper came back with a joyous smile. With him came the master of the
house. He looked steadily at the children and nodded twice.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my steward will pay you the price.
But I shall not pay at that high rate for the Egyptian dog.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The two passed on.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the Egyptian, &ldquo;is a pretty kettle of
fish.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked all the children at once.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Our present position,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.
&ldquo;Our seafaring friend,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;has sold us all for
slaves!&rdquo;</P>
<P>A hasty council succeeded the shock of this announcement. The Priest was
allowed to take part in it. His advice was &ldquo;stay,&rdquo; because they
were in no danger, and the Amulet in its completeness must be somewhere
near, or, of course, they could not have come to that place at all. And
after some discussion they agreed to this.</P>
<P>The children were treated more as guests than as slaves, but the
Egyptian was sent to the kitchen and made to work.</P>
<P>Pheles, the master of the house, went off that very evening, by the
King&rsquo;s orders, to start on another voyage. And when he was gone his
wife found the children amusing company, and kept them talking and singing
<PB ID="p335" N="335">
and dancing till quite late. &ldquo;To distract my mind from my
sorrows,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I do like being a slave,&rdquo; remarked Jane cheerfully, as they
curled up on the big, soft cushions that were to be their beds.</P>
<P>It was black night when they were awakened, each by a hand passed softly
over its face, and a low voice that whispered&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Be quiet, or all is lost.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So they were quiet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, the Priest of Amen,&rdquo;
said the whisperer. &ldquo;The man who brought us has gone to sea again,
and he has taken my Amulet from me by force, and I know no magic to get it
back. Is there magic for that in the Amulet you bear?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Every one was instantly awake by now.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We can go after him,&rdquo; said Cyril, leaping up; &ldquo;but he
might take <EMPH>ours</EMPH> as well; or he might be angry with us for
following him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to <EMPH>that</EMPH>,&rdquo; said the Egyptian in
the dark. &ldquo;Hide your Amulet well.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There in the deep blackness of that room in the Tyrian country house the
Amulet was once more held up and the word spoken.</P>
<P>All passed through on to a ship that tossed and tumbled on a
wind&hyphen;blown sea. They crouched together there till morning, and Jane
and Cyril were not at all well. When the dawn showed, dove&hyphen;coloured,
across the steely waves, they stood up as well as they could for the
tumbling of the ship. Pheles, that hardy sailor and adventurer, turned
<PB ID="p336" N="336">
quite pale when he turned round suddenly and saw them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;well, I never did!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said the Egyptian, bowing low, and that was even
more difficult than standing up, &ldquo;we are here by the magic of the
sacred Amulet that hangs round your neck.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I never did!&rdquo; repeated Pheles. &ldquo;Well,
well!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;What port is the ship bound for?&rdquo; asked Robert, with a
nautical air.</P>
<P>But Pheles said, &ldquo;Are you a navigator?&rdquo; Robert had to own
that he was not.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Pheles, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
that we&rsquo;re bound for the Tin Isles. Tyre alone knows where the Tin
Isles are. It is a splendid secret we keep from all the world. It is as
great a thing to us as your magic to you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He spoke in quite a new voice, and seemed to respect both the children
and the Amulet a good deal more than he had done before.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The King sent you, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Pheles, &ldquo;he bade me set sail with half
a score brave gentlemen and this crew. You shall go with us, and see many
wonders.&rdquo; He bowed and left them.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo; said Robert, when Pheles had
caused them to be left along with a breakfast of dried fruits and a sort of
hard biscuit.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Wait till he lands in the Tin Isles,&rdquo; said
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, &ldquo;then we can get the barbarians
<PB ID="p337" N="337">
to help us. We will attack him by night and tear the sacred Amulet from his
accursed heathen neck,&rdquo; he added, grinding his teeth.</P>
<P>&ldquo;When shall we get to the Tin Isles?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;six months, perhaps, or a year,&rdquo; said the Egyptian
cheerfully.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A year of <EMPH>this</EMPH>?&rdquo; cried Jane, and Cyril, who
was still feeling far too unwell to care about breakfast, hugged himself
miserably and shuddered.</P>
<P>It was Robert who said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here, we can shorten that year. Jane, out with the Amulet!
Wish that we were where the Amulet will be when the ship is twenty miles
from the Tin Island. That&rsquo;ll give us time to mature our
plans.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was done&mdash;the work of a moment&mdash;and there they were on the
same ship, between grey northern sky and grey northern sea. The sun was
setting in a pale yellow line. It was the same ship, but it was changed,
and so were the crew. Weather&hyphen;worn and dirty were the sailors, and
their clothes torn and ragged. And the children saw that, of course, though
they had skipped the nine months, the ship had had to live through them.
Pheles looked thinner, and his face was rugged and anxious.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the charm has brought you back! I
have prayed to it daily these nine months&mdash;and now you are here? Have
you no magic that can help?&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p338" N="338">
<P>&ldquo;What is your need?&rdquo; asked the Egyptian quietly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I need a great wave that shall whelm away the foreign ship that
follows us. A month ago it lay in wait for us, by the pillars of the gods,
and it follows, follows, to find out the secret of Tyre&mdash;the place of
the Tin Islands. If I could steer by night I could escape them yet, but
tonight there will be no stars.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;My magic will not serve you here,&rdquo; said the Egyptian.</P>
<P>But Robert said, &ldquo;My magic will not bring up great waves, but I
can show you how to steer without stars.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He took out the shilling compass, still, fortunately, in working order,
that he had bought off another boy at school for fivepence, a piece of
indiarubber, a strip of whalebone, and half a stick of red
sealing&hyphen;wax.</P>
<P>And he showed Pheles how it worked. And Pheles wondered at the
compass&rsquo;s magic truth.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I will give it to you,&rdquo; Robert said, &ldquo;in return for
that charm about your neck.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Pheles made no answer. He first laughed, snatched the compass from
Robert&rsquo;s hand, and turned away still laughing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Be comforted,&rdquo; the Priest whispered, &ldquo;our time will
come.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The dusk deepened, and Pheles, crouched beside a dim lantern, steered by
the shilling compass from the Crystal Palace.</P>
<PB ID="p339" N="339">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet339"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p340" N="340">
<P>No one ever knew how the other ship sailed, but suddenly, in the deep
night, the look&hyphen;out man at the stern cried out in a terrible
voice&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;She is close upon us!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And we,&rdquo; said Pheles, &ldquo;are close to the
harbour.&rdquo; He was silent a moment, then suddenly he altered the
ship&rsquo;s course, and then he stood up and spoke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good friends and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who are bound
with me in this brave venture by our King&rsquo;s command, the false,
foreign ship is close on our heels. If we land, they land, and only the
gods know whether they might not beat us in fight, and themselves survive
to carry back the tale of Tyre&rsquo;s secret island to enrich their own
miserable land. Shall this be?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried the half&hyphen;dozen men near him. The
slaves were rowing hard below and could not hear his words.</P>
<P>The Egyptian leaped upon him; suddenly, fiercely, as a wild beast leaps.
&ldquo;Give me back my Amulet,&rdquo; he cried, and caught at the charm.
The chain that held it snapped, and it lay in the Priest&rsquo;s hand.</P>
<P>Pheles laughed, standing balanced to the leap of the ship that answered
the oarstroke.</P>
<P>&ldquo;This is no time for charms and mummeries,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lived like men, and we&rsquo;ll die like gentlemen for
the honour and glory of Tyre, our splendid city. &lsquo;Tyre,
<PB ID="p341" N="341">
Tyre for ever! It&rsquo;s Tyre that rules the waves.&rsquo; I steer her
straight for the Dragon rocks, and we go down for our city, as brave men
should. The creeping cowards who follow shall go down as slaves&mdash;and
slaves they shall be to us&mdash;when we live again. Tyre, Tyre for
ever!&rdquo;</P>
<P>A great shout went up, and the slaves below joined in it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Quick, the Amulet,&rdquo; cried Anthea, and held it up.
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; held up the one he had snatched from Pheles. The
word was spoken, and the two great arches grew on the plunging ship in the
shrieking wind under the dark sky. From each Amulet a great and beautiful
green light streamed and shone far out over the waves. It illuminated, too,
the black faces and jagged teeth of the great rocks that lay not two
ships&rsquo; lengths from the boat&rsquo;s peaked nose.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Tyre, Tyre for ever! It&rsquo;s Tyre that rules the waves!&rdquo;
the voices of the doomed rose in a triumphant shout. The children scrambled
through the arch, and stood trembling and blinking in the Fitzroy Street
parlour, and in their ears still sounded the whistle of the wind, and the
rattle of the oars, the crash of the ship&rsquo;s bow on the rocks, and the
last shout of the brave gentlemen&hyphen;adventurers who went to their
deaths singing, for the sake of the city they loved.</P>
<PB ID="p342" N="342">
<P><FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet342"></FIGURE></P>
<PB ID="p343" N="343">
<P>&ldquo;And so we&rsquo;ve lost the other half of the Amulet
again,&rdquo; said Anthea, when they had told the Psammead all about
it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nonsense, pooh!&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;that
wasn&rsquo;t the other half. It was the same half that you&rsquo;ve
got&mdash;the one that wasn&rsquo;t crushed and lost.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But how could it be the same?&rdquo; said Anthea gently.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, of course. The one you&rsquo;ve got is a good
many years older, but at any rate it&rsquo;s not the other one. What did
you say when you wished?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I forget,&rdquo; said Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Psammead. &ldquo;You said,
&lsquo;Take us where <EMPH>you</EMPH> are&rsquo;&mdash;and it did, so you
see it was the same half.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;But you mark my words,&rdquo; the Psammead went on,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have trouble with that Priest yet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why, he was quite friendly,&rdquo; said Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;All the same you&rsquo;d better beware of the Reverend
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sick of the Amulet,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;we
shall never get it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh yes we shall,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember December 3rd?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Jinks!&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten
that.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t feel at all well.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;I should not go
out into the Past again till
<PB ID="p344" N="344">
that date. You&rsquo;ll find it safer not to go where you&rsquo;re likely
to meet that Egyptian any more just at present.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll do as you say,&rdquo; said Anthea
soothingly, &ldquo;though there&rsquo;s something about his face that I
really do like.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Still, you don&rsquo;t want to run after him, I suppose,&rdquo;
snapped the Psammead. &ldquo;You wait till the 3rd, and then see what
happens.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cyril and Jane were feeling far from well, Anthea was always obliging,
so Robert was overruled. And they promised. And none of them, not even the
Psammead, at all foresaw, as you no doubt do quite plainly, exactly what it
was that <EMPH>would</EMPH> happen on that memorable date.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE HEART&rsquo;S DESIRE</HEAD>
<P><HI>IF</HI> I only had time I could tell you lots of things. For
instance, how, in spite of the advice of the Psammead, the four children
did, one very wet day, go through their Amulet Arch into the golden desert,
and there find the great Temple of Baalbec and meet with the Ph&oelig;nix
whom they never thought to see again. And how the Ph&oelig;nix did not
remember them at all until it went into a sort of prophetic trance&mdash;if
that can be called remembering. But, alas! I <EMPH>haven&rsquo;t</EMPH>
time, so I must leave all that out though it was a wonderfully thrilling
adventure. I must leave out, too, all about the visit of the children to
the Hippodrome with the Psammead in its travelling bag, and about how the
wishes of the people round about them were granted so suddenly and
surprisingly that at last the Psammead had to be taken hurriedly home by
Anthea, who consequently missed half the performance. Then there was the
time when, Nurse having gone to tea with a friend out
<PB ID="p346" N="346">
Ivalunk way, they were playing &ldquo;devil in the dark&rdquo;&mdash;and in
the midst of that most creepy pastime the postman&rsquo;s knock frightened
Jane nearly out of her life. She took in the letters, however, and put them
in the back of the hat&hyphen;stand drawer, so that they should be safe.
And safe they were, for she never thought of them again for weeks and
weeks.</P>
<P>One really good thing happened when they took the Psammead to a
magic&hyphen;lantern show and lecture at the boys&rsquo; school at Camden
Town. The lecture was all about our soldiers in South Africa. And the
lecturer ended up by saying, &ldquo;And I hope every boy in this room has
in his heart the seeds of courage and heroism and self&hyphen;sacrifice,
and I wish that every one of you may grow up to be noble and brave and
unselfish, worthy citizens of this great Empire for whom our soldiers have
freely given their lives.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And, of course, this came true&mdash;which was a distinct score for
Camden Town.</P>
<P>As Anthea said, it was unlucky that the lecturer said boys, because now
she and Jane would have to be noble and unselfish, if at all, without any
outside help. But Jane said, &ldquo;I daresay we are already because of our
beautiful natures. It&rsquo;s only boys that have to be made brave by
magic&rdquo;&mdash;which nearly led to a first&hyphen;class row.</P>
<P>And I daresay you would like to know all about the affair of the fishing
rod, and the fish&hyphen;hooks, and the cook next door&mdash;which
<PB ID="p347" N="347">
was amusing from some points of view, though not perhaps the
cook&rsquo;s&mdash;but there really is no time even for that.</P>
<P>The only thing that there&rsquo;s time to tell about is the Adventure of
Maskelyne and Cooke&rsquo;s, and the Unexpected Apparition&mdash;which is
also the beginning of the end.</P>
<P>It was Nurse who broke into the gloomy music of the autumn rain on the
window panes by suggesting a visit to the Egyptian Hall, England&rsquo;s
Home of Mystery. Though they had good, but private reasons to know that
their own particular personal mystery was of a very different brand, the
four all brightened at the idea. All children, as well as a good many
grown&hyphen;ups, love conjuring.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Piccadilly,&rdquo; said old Nurse, carefully
counting out the proper number of shillings into Cyril&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;not so very far down on the left from the Circus. There&rsquo;s big
pillars outside, something like Carter&rsquo;s seed place in Holborn, as
used to be Day and Martin&rsquo;s blacking when I was a gell. And something
like Euston Station, only not so big.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said everybody.</P>
<P>So they started.</P>
<P>But though they walked along the left&hyphen;hand side of Piccadilly
they saw no pillared building that was at all like Carter&rsquo;s seed
warehouse or Euston Station or England&rsquo;s Home of Mystery as they
remembered it.</P>
<P>At last they stopped a hurried lady, and asked her the way to Maskelyne
and Cooke&rsquo;s.</P>
<PB ID="p348" N="348">
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said, pushing past
them. &ldquo;I always shop at the Stores.&rdquo; Which just shows, as Jane
said, how ignorant grown&hyphen;up people are.</P>
<P>It was a policeman who at last explained to them that England&rsquo;s
Mysteries are now appropriately enough enacted at St George&rsquo;s Hall.
So they tramped to Langham Place, and missed the first two items in the
programme. But they were in time for the most wonderful magic appearances
and disappearances, which they could hardly believe&mdash;even with all
their knowledge of a larger magic&mdash;was not really magic after all.</P>
<P>&ldquo;If only the Babylonians could have seen <EMPH>this</EMPH>
conjuring,&rdquo; whispered Cyril. &ldquo;It takes the shine out of their
old conjurer, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Anthea and several other members of the
audience.</P>
<P>Now there was a vacant seat next to Robert. And it was when all eyes
were fixed on the stage where Mr Devant was pouring out glasses of all
sorts of different things to drink, out of one kettle with one spout, and
the audience were delightedly tasting them, that Robert felt some one in
that vacant seat. He did not feel some one sit down in it. It was just that
one moment there was no one sitting there, and the next moment, suddenly,
there was some one.</P>
<P>Robert turned. The some one who had suddenly filled that empty place was
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, the Priest of Amen!</P>
<PB ID="p349" N="349">
<P>Though the eyes of the audience were fixed on Mr David Devant, Mr David
Devant&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the audience. And it happened that his
eyes were more particularly fixed on that empty chair. So that he saw quite
plainly the sudden appearance, from nowhere, of the Egyptian Priest.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A jolly good trick,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and worked
under my own eyes, in my own hall. I&rsquo;ll find out how that&rsquo;s
done.&rdquo; He had never seen a trick that he could not do himself if he
tried.</P>
<P>By this time a good many eyes in the audience had turned on the
clean&hyphen;shaven, curiously&hyphen;dressed figure of the Egyptian
Priest.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr Devant, rising to the
occasion, &ldquo;this is a trick I have never before performed. The empty
seat, third from the end, second row, gallery&mdash;you will now find
occupied by an Ancient Egyptian, warranted genuine.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He little knew how true his words were.</P>
<P>And now all eyes were turned on the Priest and the children, and the
whole audience, after a moment&rsquo;s breathless surprise, shouted
applause. Only the lady on the other side of Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; drew
back a little. She <EMPH>knew</EMPH> no one had passed her, and, as she
said later, over tea and cold tongue, &ldquo;it was that sudden it made her
flesh creep.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; seemed very much annoyed at the notice he was
exciting.</P>
<PB ID="p350" N="350">
<P>&ldquo;Come out of this crowd,&rdquo; he whispered to Robert. &ldquo;I
must talk with you apart.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Jane whispered. &ldquo;I did so want to see the
Mascot Moth, and the Ventriloquist.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; was Robert&rsquo;s return
whisper.</P>
<P>&ldquo;How did you get to Egypt and to Tyre?&rdquo; retorted
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;. &ldquo;Come, let us leave this crowd.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it, I suppose,&rdquo; Robert shrugged
angrily. But they all got up.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Confederates!&rdquo; said a man in the row behind. &ldquo;Now
they go round to the back and take part in the next scene.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we did,&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Confederate yourself!&rdquo; said Cyril. And so they got away,
the audience applauding to the last.</P>
<P>In the vestibule of St George&rsquo;s Hall they disguised
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; as well as they could, but even with Robert&rsquo;s
hat and Cyril&rsquo;s Inverness cape he was too striking a figure for
foot&hyphen;exercise in the London streets. It had to be a cab, and it took
the last, least money of all of them. They stopped the cab a few doors from
home, and then the girls went in and engaged old Nurse&rsquo;s attention by
an account of the conjuring and a fervent entreaty for
dripping&hyphen;toast with their tea, leaving the front door open so that
while Nurse was talking to them the boys could creep quietly in with
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; and smuggle
<PB ID="p351" N="351">
him, unseen, up the stairs into their bedroom.</P>
<P>When the girls came up they found the Egyptian Priest sitting on the
side of Cyril&rsquo;s bed, his hands on his knees, looking like a statue of
a king.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Cyril impatiently. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
begin till we&rsquo;re all here. And shut the door, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>When the door was shut the Egyptian said&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;My interests and yours are one.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;ll be a
jolly sight more interesting if you keep following us about in a decent
country with no more clothes on than <EMPH>that</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; said the Priest. &ldquo;What is this country? and
what is this <EMPH>time</EMPH>?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The country&rsquo;s England,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and the
time&rsquo;s about six thousand years later than <EMPH>your</EMPH>
time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Amulet, then,&rdquo; said the Priest, deeply thoughtful,
&ldquo;gives the power to move to and fro in time as well as in
space?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; said Cyril gruffly. &ldquo;Look
here, it&rsquo;ll be tea&hyphen;time directly. What are we to do with
you?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You have one&hyphen;half of the Amulet, I the other,&rdquo; said
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;. &ldquo;All that is now needed is the pin to join
them.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;The half
you&rsquo;ve got is the same half as the one we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p352" N="352">
<P>&ldquo;But the same thing cannot be in the same place and the same time,
and yet be not one, but twain,&rdquo; said the Priest. &ldquo;See, here is
my half.&rdquo; He laid it on the Marcella counterpane. &ldquo;Where is
yours?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane watching the eyes of the others, unfastened the string of the
Amulet and laid it on the bed, but too far off for the Priest to seize it,
even if he had been so dishonourable. Cyril and Robert stood beside him,
ready to spring on him if one of his hands had moved but ever so little
towards the magic treasure that was theirs. But his hands did not move,
only his eyes opened very wide, and so did every one else&rsquo;s for the
Amulet the Priest had now quivered and shook; and then, as steel is drawn
to the magnet, it was drawn across the white counterpane, nearer and nearer
to the Amulet, warm from the neck of Jane. And then, as one drop of water
mingles with another on a rain&hyphen;wrinkled window&hyphen;pane, as one
bead of quick&hyphen;silver is drawn into another bead,
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;&rsquo;s Amulet slipped into the other one, and,
behold! there was no more but the one Amulet!</P>
<P>&ldquo;Black magic!&rdquo; cried Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, and sprang
forward to snatch the Amulet that had swallowed his. But Anthea caught it
up, and at the same moment the Priest was jerked back by a rope thrown over
his head. It drew, tightened with the pull of his forward leap, and bound
his elbows to his sides. Before he had time to use his strength
<PB ID="p353" N="353">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet353"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p354" N="354">
to free himself, Robert had knotted the cord behind him and tied it to the
bedpost. Then the four children, overcoming the priest&rsquo;s wrigglings
and kickings, tied his legs with more rope.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Robert, breathing hard, and drawing the
last knot tight, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d have a try for <EMPH>Ours</EMPH>, so I
got the ropes out of the box&hyphen;room, so as to be ready.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The girls, with rather white faces, applauded his foresight.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Loosen these bonds!&rdquo; cried Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; in fury,
&ldquo;before I blast you with the seven secret curses of
Amen&hyphen;R&amacr;!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be likely to loose them
<EMPH>after</EMPH>,&rdquo; Robert retorted.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t quarrel!&rdquo; said Anthea desperately.
&ldquo;Look here, he <EMPH>has</EMPH> just as much right to the thing as we
have. This,&rdquo; she took up the Amulet that had swallowed the other one,
&ldquo;this has got his in it as well as being ours. Let&rsquo;s go
shares.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried the Priest, writhing.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;if you make a row we
can just open that window and call the police&mdash;the guards, you
know&mdash;and tell them you&rsquo;ve been trying to rob us.
<EMPH>Now</EMPH> will you shut up and listen to reason?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; sulkily.</P>
<P>But reason could not be spoken to him till a whispered counsel had been
held in the far corner by the wash&hyphen;hand&hyphen;stand and the
<PB ID="p355" N="355">
towel&hyphen;horse, a counsel rather long and very earnest.</P>
<P>At last Anthea detached herself from the group, and went back to the
Priest.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said in her kind little voice, &ldquo;we
want to be friends. We want to help you. Let&rsquo;s make a treaty.
Let&rsquo;s join together to <EMPH>get</EMPH> the Amulet&mdash;the whole
one, I mean. And then it shall belong to you as much as to us, and we shall
all get our hearts&rsquo; desire.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Fair words,&rdquo; said the Priest, &ldquo;grow no
onions.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>We</EMPH> say, &lsquo;Butter no parsnips,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Jane put in. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see we <EMPH>want</EMPH> to be
fair? Only we want to bind you in the chains of honour and upright
dealing.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Will you deal fairly by us?&rdquo; said Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the Priest. &ldquo;By the sacred, secret name
that is written under the Altar of Amen&hyphen;R&amacr;, I will deal fairly
by you. Will you, too, take the oath of honourable partnership?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anthea, on the instant, and added rather rashly.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t swear in England, except in police&hyphen;courts,
where the guards are, you know, and you don&rsquo;t want to go there. But
when we <EMPH>say</EMPH> we&rsquo;ll do a thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s the same
as an oath to us&mdash;we do it. You trust us, and we&rsquo;ll trust
you.&rdquo; She began to unbind his legs, and the boys hastened to untie
his arms.</P>
<PB ID="p356" N="356">
<P>When he was free he stood up, stretched his arms, and laughed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am stronger than you and my oath is
void. I have sworn by nothing, and my oath is nothing likewise. For there
<EMPH>is</EMPH> no secret, sacred name under the altar of
Amen&hyphen;R&amacr;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, yes there is!&rdquo; said a voice from under the bed. Every
one started&mdash;Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; most of all.</P>
<P>Cyril stooped and pulled out the bath of sand where the Psammead
slept.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know everything, though you <EMPH>are</EMPH> a
Divine Father of the Temple of Amen,&rdquo; said the Psammead shaking
itself till the sand fell tinkling on the bath edge. &ldquo;There
<EMPH>is</EMPH> a secret, sacred name beneath the altar of
Amen&hyphen;R&amacr;. Shall I call on that name?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried the Priest in terror. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
Jane, too. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any calling
names.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, who had turned very
white indeed under his natural brownness, &ldquo;I was only going to say
that though there isn&rsquo;t any name under&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;There <EMPH>is</EMPH>,&rdquo; said the Psammead
threateningly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well, even if there <EMPH>wasn&rsquo;t</EMPH>, I will be bound by
the wordless oath of your strangely upright land, and having said that I
will be your friend&mdash;I will be it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Psammead; &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s the tea&hyphen;bell. What are you
<PB ID="p357" N="357">
going to do with your distinguished partner? He can&rsquo;t go down to tea
like that, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You see we can&rsquo;t do anything till the 3rd of
December,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s when we are to find the
whole charm. What can we do with Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; till
then?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Box&hyphen;room,&rdquo; said Cyril briefly, &ldquo;and smuggle up
his meals. It will be rather fun.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Like a fleeing Cavalier concealed from exasperated
Roundheads,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>So Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; was taken up to the box&hyphen;room and made
as comfortable as possible in a snug nook between an old nursery fender and
the wreck of a big four&hyphen;poster. They gave him a big rag&hyphen;bag
to sit on, and an old, moth&hyphen;eaten fur coat off the nail on the door
to keep him warm. And when they had had their own tea they took him some.
He did not like the tea at all, but he liked the bread and butter, and cake
that went with it. They took it in turns to sit with him during the
evening, and left him fairly happy and quite settled for the night.</P>
<P>But when they went up in the morning with a kipper, a quarter of which
each of them had gone without at breakfast, Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; was
gone! There was the cosy corner with the rag&hyphen;bag, and the
moth&hyphen;eaten fur coat&mdash;but the cosy corner was empty.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Good riddance!&rdquo; was naturally the first delightful thought
in each mind. The second
<PB ID="p358" N="358">
was less pleasing, because every one at once remembered that since his
Amulet had been swallowed up by theirs&mdash;which hung once more round the
neck of Jane&mdash;he could have no possible means of returning to his
Egyptian past. Therefore he must be still in England, and probably
somewhere quite near them, plotting mischief.</P>
<P>The attic was searched, to prevent mistakes, but quite vainly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The best thing we can do,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;is to go
through the half Amulet straight away, get the whole Amulet, and come
back.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Anthea hesitated. &ldquo;Would that be
quite fair? Perhaps he isn&rsquo;t really a base deceiver. Perhaps
something&rsquo;s happened to him.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Happened?&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;not it! Besides, what
<EMPH>could</EMPH> happen?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Anthea. &ldquo;Perhaps burglars
came in the night, and accidentally killed him, and took away the&mdash;all
that was mortal of him, you know&mdash;to avoid discovery.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Or perhaps,&rdquo; said Cyril, &ldquo;they hid the&mdash;all that
was mortal, in one of those big trunks in the box&hyphen;room. <EMPH>Shall
we go back and look?</EMPH>?&rdquo; he added grimly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Jane shuddered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and tell the
Psammead and see what it says.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s ask the learned
gentleman. If anything <EMPH>has</EMPH> happened to Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;
a gentleman&rsquo;s advice would be more useful than a Psammead&rsquo;s.
And the
<PB ID="p359" N="359">
learned gentleman&rsquo;ll only think it&rsquo;s a dream, like he always
does.&rdquo;</P>
<P>They tapped at the door, and on the &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; entered. The
learned gentleman was sitting in front of his untasted breakfast. Opposite
him, in the easy chair, sat Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;!</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the learned gentleman very earnestly,
&ldquo;please, hush! or the dream will go. I am learning ... Oh, what have
I not learned in the last hour!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;In the grey dawn,&rdquo; said the Priest, &ldquo;I left my
hiding&hyphen;place, and finding myself among these treasures from my own
country, I remained. I feel more at home here somehow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Of course I know it&rsquo;s a dream,&rdquo; said the learned
gentleman feverishly, &ldquo;but, oh, ye gods! what a dream! By Jove!
...&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Call not upon the gods,&rdquo; said the Priest, &ldquo;lest ye
raise greater ones than ye can control. Already,&rdquo; he explained to the
children, &ldquo;he and I are as brothers, and his welfare is dear to me as
my own.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;He has told me,&rdquo; the learned gentleman began, but Robert
interrupted. This was no moment for manners.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Have you told him,&rdquo; he asked the Priest, &ldquo;all about
the Amulet?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then tell him now. He is very learned. Perhaps he can tell us
what to do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; hesitated, then told&mdash;and, oddly
<PB ID="p360" N="360">
enough, none of the children ever could remember afterwards what it was
that he did tell. Perhaps he used some magic to prevent their
remembering.</P>
<P>When he had done the learned gentleman was silent, leaning his elbow on
the table and his head on his hand.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dear Jimmy,&rdquo; said Anthea gently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry
about it. We are sure to find it today, somehow.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, &ldquo;and perhaps, with
it, Death.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to bring us our hearts&rsquo; desire,&rdquo; said
Robert.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; said the Priest, &ldquo;what things
undreamed&hyphen;of and infinitely desirable lie beyond the dark
gates?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>don&rsquo;t</EMPH>,&rdquo; said Jane, almost
whimpering.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman raised his head suddenly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;go back into the Past? At a
moment when the Amulet is unwatched. Wish to be with it, and that it shall
be under your hand.&rdquo;</P>
<P>It was the simplest thing in the world! And yet none of them had ever
thought of it.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, leaping up.
&ldquo;Come <EMPH>now</EMPH>!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;May&mdash;may I come?&rdquo; the learned gentleman timidly asked.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a dream, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come, and welcome, oh brother,&rdquo; Rekh&hyphen;
<PB ID="p361" N="361">
mar&amacr; was beginning, but Cyril and Robert with one voice cried,
&ldquo;<EMPH>No</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t with us in Atlantis,&rdquo; Robert added,
&ldquo;or you&rsquo;d know better than to let him come.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Dear Jimmy,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t ask to
come. We&rsquo;ll go and be back again before you have time to know that
we&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;And he, too?&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We must keep together,&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;,
&ldquo;since there is but one perfect Amulet to which I and these children
have equal claims.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane held up the Amulet&mdash;Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; went
first&mdash;and they all passed through the great arch into which the
Amulet grew at the Name of Power.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman saw through the arch a darkness lighted by smoky
gleams. He rubbed his eyes. And he only rubbed them for ten seconds.</P>
<P>The children and the Priest were in a small, dark chamber. A square
doorway of massive stone let in gleams of shifting light, and the sound of
many voices chanting a slow, strange hymn. They stood listening. Now and
then the chant quickened and the light grew brighter, as though fuel had
been thrown on a fire.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; whispered Anthea.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And when?&rdquo; whispered Robert.</P>
<PB ID="p362" N="362">
<P>&ldquo;This is some shrine near the beginnings of belief,&rdquo; said
the Egyptian shivering. &ldquo;Take the Amulet and come away. It is cold
here in the morning of the world.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And then Jane felt that her hand was on a slab or table of stone, and,
under her hand, something that felt like the charm that had so long hung
round her neck, only it was thicker. Twice as thick.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <EMPH>here</EMPH>!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got it!&rdquo; And she hardly knew the sound of her own voice.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; repeated Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish we could see more of this Temple,&rdquo; said Robert
resistingly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; the Priest urged, &ldquo;there is death all
about, and strong magic. Listen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The chanting voices seemed to have grown louder and fiercer, and light
stronger.</P>
<P>&ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; cried Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.
&ldquo;Quick, quick, the Amulet!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jane held it up.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What a long time you&rsquo;ve been rubbing your eyes!&rdquo; said
Anthea; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see we&rsquo;ve got back?&rdquo; The learned
gentleman merely stared at her.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Miss Anthea&mdash;Miss Jane!&rdquo; It was Nurse&rsquo;s voice,
very much higher and squeaky and more exalted than usual.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; said every one. Cyril adding, &ldquo;You just
go on with the dream for a sec, Mr. Jimmy, we&rsquo;ll be back directly.
Nurse&rsquo;ll
<PB ID="p363" N="363">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet363"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p364" N="364">
come up if we don&rsquo;t. <EMPH>She</EMPH> wouldn&rsquo;t think
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; was a dream.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Then they went down. Nurse was in the hall, an orange envelope in one
hand, and a pink paper in the other.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Your Pa and Ma&rsquo;s come home. &lsquo;Reach London 11.15.
Prepare rooms as directed in letter,&rsquo; and signed in their two
names.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, hooray! hooray! hooray!&rdquo; shouted the boys and Jane. But
Anthea could not shout, she was nearer crying.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said almost in a whisper, &ldquo;then it
<EMPH>was</EMPH> true. And we <EMPH>have</EMPH> got our hearts&rsquo;
desire.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand about the letter,&rdquo; Nurse was
saying. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t <EMPH>had</EMPH> no letter.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>Oh</EMPH>!&rdquo; said Jane in a queer voice, &ldquo;I
wonder whether it was one of those ... they came that night&mdash;you know,
when we were playing &ldquo;devil in the dark&rdquo;&mdash;and I put them
in the hat&hyphen;stand drawer, behind the clothes&hyphen;brushes
and&rdquo;&mdash;she pulled out the drawer as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;and
here they are!&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a letter for Nurse and one for the children. The letters told
how Father had done being a war&hyphen;correspondent and was coming home;
and how Mother and The Lamb were going to meet him in Italy and all come
home together; and how The Lamb and Mother were quite well; and how a
telegram would be sent to tell the day and the hour of their
home&hyphen;coming.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Mercy me!&rdquo; said old Nurse. &ldquo;I declare if
<PB ID="p365" N="365">
it&rsquo;s not too bad of you, Miss Jane. I shall have a nice to&hyphen;do
getting things straight for your Pa and Ma.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, Nurse,&rdquo; said Jane, hugging her;
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it just too lovely for anything!&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come and help you,&rdquo; said Cyril.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just something upstairs we&rsquo;ve got to settle up,
and then we&rsquo;ll all come and help you.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Get along with you,&rdquo; said old Nurse, but she laughed
jollily. &ldquo;Nice help <EMPH>you&rsquo;d</EMPH> be. I know you. And
it&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock now.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was, in fact, something upstairs that they had to settle. Quite a
considerable something, too. And it took much longer than they
expected.</P>
<P>A hasty rush into the boys&rsquo; room secured the Psammead, very sandy
and very cross.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how cross and sandy it is though,&rdquo;
said Anthea, &ldquo;it ought to be there at the final council.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give the learned gentleman fits, I expect,&rdquo;
said Robert, &ldquo;when he sees it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But it didn&rsquo;t.</P>
<P>&ldquo;The dream is growing more and more wonderful,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, when the Psammead had been explained to him by
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;. &ldquo;I have dreamed this beast before.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;Jane has got the half Amulet and
I&rsquo;ve got the whole. Show up, Jane.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p366" N="366">
<P>Jane untied the string and laid her half Amulet on the table, littered
with dusty papers, and the clay cylinders marked all over with little marks
like the little prints of birds&rsquo; little feet.</P>
<P>Robert laid down the whole Amulet, and Anthea gently restrained the
eager hand of the learned gentleman as it reached out yearningly towards
the &ldquo;perfect specimen.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And then, just as before on the Marcella quilt, so now on the dusty
litter of papers and curiosities, the half Amulet quivered and shook, and
then, as steel is drawn to a magnet, it was drawn across the dusty
manuscripts, nearer and nearer to the perfect Amulet, warm from the pocket
of Robert. And then, as one drop of water mingles with another when the
panes of the window are wrinkled with rain, as one bead of mercury is drawn
into another bead, the half Amulet, that was the children&rsquo;s and was
also Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;&rsquo;s, slipped into the whole Amulet, and,
behold! there was only one&mdash;the perfect and ultimate Charm.</P>
<P>&ldquo;And <EMPH>that&rsquo;s</EMPH> all right,&rdquo; said the
Psammead, breaking a breathless silence.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthea, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got our
hearts&rsquo; desire. Father and Mother and The Lamb are coming home
today.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;But what about me?&rdquo; said Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What <EMPH>is</EMPH> your heart&rsquo;s desire?&rdquo; Anthea
asked.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Great and deep learning,&rdquo; said the Priest,
<PB ID="p367" N="367">
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;A learning greater and deeper
than that of any man of my land and my time. But learning too great is
useless. If I go back to my own land and my own age, who will believe my
tales of what I have seen in the future? Let me stay here, be the great
knower of all that has been, in that our time, so living to me, so old to
you, about which your learned men speculate unceasingly, and often,
<EMPH>he</EMPH> tells me, vainly.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;I should ask the
Amulet about that. It&rsquo;s a dangerous thing, trying to live in a time
that&rsquo;s not your own. You can&rsquo;t breathe an air that&rsquo;s
thousands of centuries ahead of your lungs without feeling the effects of
it, sooner or later. Prepare the mystic circle and consult the
Amulet.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, <EMPH>what</EMPH> a dream!&rdquo; cried the learned
gentleman. &ldquo;Dear children, if you love me&mdash;and I think you do,
in dreams and out of them&mdash;prepare the mystic circle and consult the
Amulet!&rdquo;</P>
<P>They did. As once before, when the sun had shone in August splendour,
they crouched in a circle on the floor. Now the air outside was thick and
yellow with the fog that by some strange decree always attends the Cattle
Show week. And in the street costers were shouting. &ldquo;Ur Hekau
Setcheh,&rdquo; Jane said the Name of Power. And instantly the light went
out, and all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence and
<PB ID="p368" N="368">
a darkness, both deeper than any darkness or silence that you have ever
even dreamed of imagining. It was like being deaf or blind, only darker and
quieter even than that.</P>
<P>Then out of that vast darkness and silence came a light and a voice. The
light was too faint to see anything by, and the voice was too small for you
to hear what it said. But the light and the voice grew. And the light was
the light that no man may look on and live, and the voice was the sweetest
and most terrible voice in the world. The children cast down their eyes.
And so did every one.</P>
<P>&ldquo;I speak,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;What is it that you would
hear?&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a pause. Every one was afraid to speak.</P>
<P>&ldquo;What are we to do about Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;?&rdquo; said
Robert suddenly and abruptly. &ldquo;Shall he go back through the Amulet to
his own time, or&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;No one can pass through the Amulet now,&rdquo; said the
beautiful, terrible voice, &ldquo;to any land or any time. Only when it was
imperfect could such things be. But men may pass through the perfect charm
to the perfect union, which is not of time or space.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Would you be so very kind,&rdquo; said Anthea tremulously,
&ldquo;as to speak so that we can understand you? The Psammead said
something about Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; not being able to live here, and if
he can&rsquo;t get back&mdash;&rdquo; She
<PB ID="p369" N="369">
<FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet369"></FIGURE>
<PB ID="p370" N="370">
stopped, her heart was beating desperately in her throat, as it seemed.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nobody can continue to live in a land and in a time not
appointed,&rdquo; said the voice of glorious sweetness. &ldquo;But a soul
may live, if in that other time and land there be found a soul so akin to
it as to offer it refuge, in the body of that land and time, that thus they
two may be one soul in one body.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The children exchanged discouraged glances. But the eyes of
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; and the learned gentleman met, and were kind to each
other, and promised each other many things, secret and sacred and very
beautiful.</P>
<P>Anthea saw the look.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; she said, without at all meaning to say it,
&ldquo;dear Jimmy&rsquo;s soul isn&rsquo;t at all like
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m certain it isn&rsquo;t. I
don&rsquo;t want to be rude, but it <EMPH>isn&rsquo;t</EMPH>, you know.
Dear Jimmy&rsquo;s soul is as good as gold, and&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Nothing that is not good can pass beneath the double arch of my
perfect Amulet,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;If both are willing, say the
word of Power, and let the two souls become one for ever and ever
more.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; asked Jane.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The voices were those of the Egyptian Priest and the learned gentleman,
and the voices were eager, alive, thrilled with hope and the desire of
great things.</P>
<P>So Jane took the Amulet from Robert and
<PB ID="p371" N="371">
held it up between the two men, and said, for the last time, the word of
Power.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Ur Hekau Setcheh.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The perfect Amulet grew into a double arch; the two arches leaned to
each other <FIGURE ENTITY="nesbit-amulet371"></FIGURE> making a great
A.</P>
<P>&ldquo;A. stands for Amen,&rdquo; whispered Jane; &ldquo;what he was a
priest of.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; breathed Anthea.</P>
<P>The great double arch glowed in and through the green light that had
been there since the Name of Power had first been spoken&mdash;it glowed
with a light more bright yet more soft than the other light&mdash;a glory
and splendour and sweetness unspeakable.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;, holding out his
hands.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried the learned gentleman, and he also held out
his hands.</P>
<P>Each moved forward under the glowing, glorious arch of the perfect
Amulet.</P>
<P>Then Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; quavered and shook, and as steel is drawn to
a magnet he was drawn, under the arch of magic, nearer and nearer to the
learned gentleman. And, as one drop of water mingles with another, when the
window&hyphen;glass is rain&hyphen;wrinkled, as one quick&hyphen;silver
bead is drawn to another quick&hyphen;silver bead, Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;,
Divine Father of the Temple of Amen&hyphen;R&amacr;, was drawn into,
slipped into, disappeared into, and was
<PB ID="p372" N="372">
one with Jimmy, the good, the beloved, the learned gentleman.</P>
<P>And suddenly it was good daylight and the December sun shone. The fog
has passed away like a dream.</P>
<P>The Amulet was there&mdash;little and complete in Jane&rsquo;s hand, and
there were the other children and the Psammead, and the learned gentleman.
But Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;&mdash;or the body of
Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;&mdash;was not there any more. As for his soul
...</P>
<P>&ldquo;Oh, the horrid thing!&rdquo; cried Robert, and put his foot on a
centipede as long as your finger, that crawled and wriggled and squirmed at
the learned gentleman&rsquo;s feet.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>That</EMPH>,&rdquo; said the Psammead, &ldquo;was the evil
in the soul of Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a deep silence.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Then Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;&rsquo;s <EMPH>him</EMPH> now?&rdquo;
said Jane at last.</P>
<P>&ldquo;All that was good in Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr;,&rdquo; said the
Psammead.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>He</EMPH> ought to have his heart&rsquo;s desire,
too,&rdquo; said Anthea, in a sort of stubborn gentleness.</P>
<P>&ldquo;<EMPH>His</EMPH> heart&rsquo;s desire,&rdquo; said the Psammead,
&ldquo;is the perfect Amulet you hold in your hand. Yes&mdash;and has been
ever since he first saw the broken half of it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got ours,&rdquo; said Anthea softly.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Psammead&mdash;its voice was crosser than
they had ever heard it&mdash;&ldquo;your parents are coming home. And
what&rsquo;s to become of <EMPH>me</EMPH>? I shall be found out, and
<PB ID="p373" N="373">
made a show of, and degraded in every possible way. I <EMPH>know</EMPH>
they&rsquo;ll make me go into Parliament&mdash;hateful place&mdash;all mud
and no sand. That beautiful Baalbec temple in the desert! Plenty of good
sand there, and no politics! I wish I were there, safe in the
Past&mdash;that I do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I wish you were,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman absently, yet
polite as ever.</P>
<P>The Psammead swelled itself up, turned its long snail&rsquo;s eyes in
one last lingering look at Anthea&mdash;a loving look, she always said, and
thought&mdash;and&mdash;vanished.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anthea, after a silence, &ldquo;I suppose
it&rsquo;s happy. The only thing it ever did really care for was
<EMPH>sand</EMPH>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, &ldquo;I
must have fallen asleep. I&rsquo;ve had the most extraordinary
dream.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;I hope it was a nice one,&rdquo; said Cyril with courtesy.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Yes.... I feel a new man after it. Absolutely a new
man.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There was a ring at the front&hyphen;door bell. The opening of a door.
Voices.</P>
<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <EMPH>them</EMPH>!&rdquo; cried Robert, and a thrill
ran through four hearts.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Anthea, snatching the Amulet from Jane and
pressing it into the hand of the learned gentleman.
&ldquo;Here&mdash;it&rsquo;s <EMPH>yours</EMPH>&mdash;your very own&mdash;a
present from us, because you&rsquo;re Rekh&hyphen;mar&amacr; as well as ...
I mean, because you&rsquo;re such a dear.&rdquo;</P>
<PB ID="p374" N="374">
<P>She hugged him briefly but fervently, and the four swept down the stairs
to the hall, where a cabman was bringing in boxes, and where, heavily
disguised in travelling cloaks and wraps, was their hearts&rsquo;
desire&mdash;three&hyphen;fold&mdash;Mother, Father, and The Lamb.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said the learned gentleman, left alone,
&ldquo;bless me! What a treasure! The dear children! It must be their
affection that has given me these
luminous <FOREIGN LANG="fre">aper&ccedil;us</FOREIGN>. I seem to see so
many things now&mdash;things I never saw before! The dear children! The
dear, dear children!&rdquo;</P>
